## INDEX / HOMEPAGE

### Hero Section
**Stop Renting. Start Owning.**

You built your business with your own hands. You've done the late nights and the hard mahi.

So why are you paying rent to Instagram?

Professional websites for Kiwi businesses. Built in 5 business days. Managed forever. From $995.

[CTA: Start Your Build]
[CTA: How It Works]

---

### Section: The Truth
**You're Building Your Castle on Rented Land.**

Here's what nobody tells you:
- If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
- If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
- If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?

Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

**It's time to become an Owner.**

---

### Section: Digital Handshake
**Your Handshake Is Firm. Your Work Is Solid. But Your Website?**

In person, you're the real deal. You have presence. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.

But then someone Googles you... And they find nothing. Or worse — a broken website from 2012.

**There's a disconnect.**

Your website is your Digital Handshake. It's the first thing people experience before they meet you.

// If the carpet doesn't match the drapes? People notice.

### Section: Who We Built This For

**The Tradies** (Electricians / Plumbers / Builders)
- The Pain: You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. The last thing you want is to spend hours figuring out Wix.
- The Fix: A site that ranks locally on Google and gets the phone ringing. No homework required.

**The Creatives** (Salons / Tattoo / Artists)
- The Pain: You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings and people to find your prices.
- The Fix: A beautiful portfolio site that you actually own. Instagram can go down tomorrow — you're still standing.

**The Professionals** (Consultants / Legal / Coaches)
- The Pain: You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.
- The Fix: A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.

### Section: How It Works
**Live in 5 Days. No Homework. No Jargon.**

**STEP 01: The Drive-Home Interview (15 Minutes)**
You hate writing "About Us" pages. That's why we don't make you. You call our AI Voice Agent while driving home. You just talk. We capture everything.
[NO TYPING REQUIRED]

**STEP 02: The Factory Build**
We build it in 5 days using Astro & Tailwind CSS (Silicon Valley tech). It loads instantly, ranks high, and is impossible to hack.
[UNDER 1 SECOND LOAD] [MOBILE FIRST]

**STEP 03: The Caretakers**
We hand you the keys, but we stay on as caretakers. Hosting, security, updates — sorted. Plus a full design refresh every year.

---

### Section: Real People. Real Results.

"Building a website was my barrier to market—I didn't have the skills. You helped me fulfill a dream. You made this come true."
— Nicolette, Ember & Ice (Wellness Studio)

"I'm definitely not up to speed on tech stuff. While I was still figuring out Google Drive, Lian had already built the whole thing from our Facebook. My mates reckon it's banging!"
— Rueben, Johnson & Sons (Commercial Builder)

---

### Section: The Caretaker Model (Not an Agency)

**Most agencies:**
→ Build your site
→ Send an invoice
→ Disappear

**We do it differently. We're Caretakers.**

✓ We build it (5 days)
✓ We host it (forever)
✓ We fix it (when it breaks)
✓ We refresh it (once a year, free)

You focus on your business. We keep the digital HQ running.

## HOW IT WORKS PAGE

### Hero
**How We Build Your Digital HQ in 5 Days.**

No forms to fill out. No tech jargon. No homework.
Just one phone call and we handle the rest.

---

### The Process (Timeline)

**01: The Drive-Home Interview**
You hate writing "About Us" pages. So don't. Call our AI Voice Agent while driving home or having a coffee.

The AI asks:
> "What do you actually do?"
> "Who are your customers?"
> "What makes you different?"

Time Required: 15 Mins
No writing. No forms.

**02: We Raid Your Content**
We go hunting on your Facebook, Instagram, and Google Reviews to find photos and info.

Most businesses already have 90% of the content they need — it's just scattered. We gather it.

Time Required: 0 Mins
We do this ourselves.

**03: The Factory Build**
Days 1-4. We build your site using Astro + Tailwind CSS.
✓ Under 1 second load time
✓ Mobile-first design
✓ SEO Fundamentals

Action: We Build
You run your business.

**04: The Preview (Day 5)**
We send you a private link. You view it on your phone.

If you want changes: We make them in 24 hours.
If you hate it: We refund you (minus ~3% processing fees).

Decision: Love/Hate
Refund if you hate it.

**05: You Go Live**
We flip the switch. Your domain is live. Google is notified.

You get back to work. We become the caretakers.

### The Caretaker Model

**You own the house. We mow the lawns.**

Most websites die a slow death because nobody updates the plugins or fixes the security. We handle all the boring stuff so you don't have to.

**The "Text Us" Service**

Need something updated?
- "Hey, change my phone number to..."
- "Can you add this photo from the job?"
- "Update my price list."

Just text me. I do it within 24 hours.

**What's Included?**
✓ Hosting & Security - Fast servers, SSL certificates, daily backups.
✓ Unlimited Updates - Text or email us changes anytime.
✓ Annual Refresh - Every 12 months, we redesign your site for free.

---

### How Updates Work (No Meetings Required)

Once you're live, updates are simple.

Text us a photo or a message. We add it to our queue. Usually within 2–3 days, it's done.

No Zoom calls. No back-and-forth emails. Just text → done.

This keeps us sane and keeps your costs down. (That's why $149/mo works.)

---

### What They Say About The Process

"I was dreading building a website. Lian made it so easy — I literally just talked on the phone for 15 minutes and she handled everything else. I didn't have to write a single word."
— Dave, Electrician

"I've tried Wix three times and quit every time. YourHQ was the opposite of that stress. They just... did it. And it looks better than anything I could've made."
— Sarah, Salon Owner

### Why Is There A Monthly Fee?

**Infrastructure**
• High-speed Vercel hosting
• Daily Backups & Restore
• SSL Security Certificate
• Domain Name Renewal (.co.nz)

**Human Support**
• Unlimited "Text Us" updates (Launch/Growth)
• Tech fixes if things break
• Annual Design Refresh (Value $2k)
• Real humans, based in Whangārei

Think of it like rates or body corporate fees for your digital property.

---

### Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

Most web designers build a site, then ghost you.

**Your website is alive. It needs:**
• Security updates (weekly)
• Performance tweaks (ongoing)
• Hosting (always on)
• The odd fix when something breaks

**If you're paying per fix, you either:**
A) Get stuck with a broken site you can't afford to fix
B) Overpay for simple changes

Subscription fixes this. It's predictable. It's fair.

Think of it like your phone plan vs. paying per text.

---

### The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We build your site. You see the preview.
If you don't love it, we refund you.

(Minus hard costs: ~3% Stripe fees + domain if purchased. You get back ~93-94% of your payment).

We've never had to refund anyone. But the option exists because we put our money where our mouth is.

---

### What You're Actually Comparing

**WHY $995 + $149/MO ISN'T CHEAP. IT'S FAIR.**

Here's what the alternatives actually cost:

**❌ DIY (Wix/Shopify/Squarespace)**
• $30–50/mo for tool
• 40+ hours of your time (@ $50/hr = $2,000)
• Still looks generic
• You're the support person
= $2,600–3,000 + your sanity

**❌ Traditional Agency**
• $5,000–15,000 setup
• $100–250/hr for changes
• 6–12 week build time
• You're often abandoned after launch
= $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years

**✓ YourHQ**
• $995 setup (5 days)
• $149/mo (forever support + annual refresh)
• First 2 years = $4,573
• You own it. We handle it.

Professional build + 2 years support = $4,573
That's less than half what most agencies charge just to build it.

## PRIVACY & SOVEREIGNTY PAGE

### Hero
**Privacy & Sovereignty**

We believe you should own your digital home and the data inside it. Here is how we protect that right.

---

YourHQ operates under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020. Beyond legal compliance, our core philosophy is **Data Sovereignty**: We are the caretakers of your digital assets, but you remain the owner.

---

### 1. Information We Collect

To build and maintain your website, we collect:
- Business Identity: Name, contact details, and business descriptions.
- Website Content: Images, text, logos, and files you upload to our Shared Drive.
- Voice Data: Audio recordings from your "Drive-Home Interview" with our AI agent.
- Technical Data: Analytics on how your website performs (if on the Growth plan).

---

### 2. Our Technology Stack & Data Storage

We believe in radical transparency regarding where your data lives. We use best-in-class infrastructure to ensure speed and security.

**Supabase:** We use Supabase for our database. We implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies, meaning your data is cryptographically segregated. Only authorized users (you and our admins) can access your specific records.

**Stripe:** We use Stripe for all payments. YourHQ never sees or stores your credit card numbers. Stripe adheres to the highest level of PCI Service Provider Level 1 standards.

**ElevenLabs:** Used for our AI Interview Agent. Your voice data is processed solely to transcribe information for your website build. We do not use your voice to clone your identity.

**Vercel:** Your website files are hosted on Vercel's global edge network to ensure 99.9% uptime and lightning-fast loading speeds for your customers.

---

### 3. Data Sovereignty (Ownership)

This is where we differ from platforms like Facebook or Instagram:

- You own your content. We claim no intellectual property rights over the text and images you provide.
- You own your customer list. Any leads generated by your website belong 100% to you. We do not mine, sell, or share your customer data.
- Portability. If you choose to leave YourHQ (after the minimum term), we provide you with a static export of your website files. We do not hold your digital presence hostage.

---

### 4. How We Use Voice Data

When you speak with our AI Agent (Penny/Lian's Digital Twin):
- The conversation is recorded and transcribed to generate website copy.
- These recordings are stored securely within our private logs.
- We do not share these recordings with third parties for marketing purposes.

---

### 5. Your Rights

Under the NZ Privacy Act, you have the right to:
- Ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you.
- Ask for it to be corrected if you think it is wrong.
- Request that your data be deleted from our servers (subject to us needing to keep billing records for tax purposes).
