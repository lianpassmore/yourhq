## HOMEPAGE (index.astro)

### Announcement Bar
🚀 Taking bookings for week of Dec 15

### Hero Badge
Based in Aotearoa NZ — Working Globally

### Hero Headline
Stop Renting.
Start Owning.

### Hero Subheadline
You built your business with your own hands.

**So why are you paying rent to Instagram?**

### Hero Description
Professional websites for Kiwi businesses. Built in 5 business days. Managed forever.

### Hero CTAs
- Start Your Build
- How It Works

## SECTION: The Truth

### Headline
You're Building Your
Castle on Rented Land.

### Body Copy
Here's what nobody tells you:

- If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
- If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
- If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?

### Callout Box
**Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.**
(Even if business is good.)

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

**It's time to become an Owner.**

---

## SECTION: Digital Handshake

### Headline
Your Handshake Is Firm.
Your Work Is Solid.
But Your Website?

### Body Copy
In person, you're the real deal. You have presence. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.

But then someone Googles you... And they find nothing. Or worse — a broken website from 2012.

**There's a disconnect.**

Your website is your Digital Handshake. It's the first thing people experience before they meet you.

### Footer Note
// First impressions still matter.

## SECTION: Who We Built This For

### Section Title
Who We Built This For

### Card 1: The Tradies
**Category:** Electricians / Plumbers / Builders

**The Pain:**
You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. The last thing you want is to spend hours figuring out Wix.

**The Fix:**
A site that ranks locally on Google and gets the phone ringing. No homework required.

### Card 2: The Creatives
**Category:** Salons / Tattoo / Artists

**The Pain:**
You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings and people to find your prices.

**The Fix:**
A beautiful portfolio site that you actually own. Instagram can go down tomorrow — you're still standing.

### Card 3: The Professionals
**Category:** Consultants / Legal / Coaches

**The Pain:**
You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.

**The Fix:**
A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.

---

## SECTION: How It Works

### Section Headline
Live in 5 Days.
No Homework.
No Jargon.

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview (15 Minutes)
You hate writing "About Us" pages. That's why we don't make you. You call our Voice Agent while driving home. You just talk. We capture everything.

Do it while driving home, having a coffee, or after putting the kids to bed. We designed this because we know you have zero brainpower left after a full day.

**Badge:** NO TYPING REQUIRED

### Step 02: The Factory Build
We build it in 5 days using modern, lightning-fast tech used by top startups. It loads instantly, ranks high, and is impossible to hack.

**Badges:**
- UNDER 1 SECOND LOAD
- MOBILE FIRST

### Step 03: The Caretakers
We hand you the keys, but we stay on as caretakers. Hosting, security, updates — sorted. Plus a full design refresh every year.

---

## SECTION: Testimonials

### Section Title
Real People. Real Results.

### Testimonial 1
"Building a website was my barrier to market—I didn't have the skills. You helped me fulfill a dream. You made this come true."

**— Nicolette, Ember & Ice**
WELLNESS STUDIO

### Testimonial 2
"I'm definitely not up to speed on tech stuff. While I was still figuring out Google Drive, Lian had already built the whole thing from our Facebook. My mates reckon it's banging!"

**— Reuben, Johnson & Sons**
COMMERCIAL BUILDER

## SECTION: The Last Website You'll Ever Buy

### Headline
The Last Website
You'll Ever Buy.

### Body Copy
Most websites rot.

They look great on Day 1, but three years later, they look tired.
Then you have to pay another $5,000 to rebuild it.

### Callout Box (Dark Background)
**Not with YourHQ.**

We include a full design refresh every 12 months.
New fonts, new layout, new vibe.

### Comparison: The Old Way
You pay the setup fee once.
Three years later, you pay it again.
And again. And again.

### Comparison: The YourHQ Way
You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.
**Total Rebuild Fees: $0**

## SECTION: The Caretaker Model

### Headline
The Caretaker Model (Not an Agency)

### Most Agencies (Red Box)
Most agencies:
- Build your site
- Send an invoice
- Disappear

**We do it differently. We're Caretakers.**

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
✓ We build it (5 days)
✓ We host it (forever)
✓ We fix it (when it breaks)
✓ We refresh it (once a year, free)

### Closing Line
You focus on your business. We keep the digital HQ running.

## SECTION: What Your Monthly Fee Actually Covers

### Headline
What Your Monthly Fee Actually Covers

It's not just hosting. It's your next website, already paid for.

### Reason 1: Your Next Website Is Already Paid For
Most businesses pay $5,000 every few years to rebuild their site when it starts looking tired. That's $1,666 per year just to stay current.

With YourHQ, your **Annual Design Refresh** is included in your monthly fee. When your 12-month anniversary rolls around, we update your fonts, layout, and hero section. You get a fresh-looking website every year — no surprise invoice.

**Think of your monthly fee as a website savings account.**
Every month, you're putting away a little so your refresh is already covered when the time comes.

### Reason 2: It's a Claimable Business Expense
Just like your phone bill, your insurance, or your Xero subscription — your accountant can generally claim this back as a regular business expense.

✓ No complicated depreciation schedules
✓ No massive upfront cash hit
✓ Simple monthly expense your accountant will recognise

(Tax situations vary — check with your accountant, but most business owners can claim this.)

### Reason 3: We Keep the Lights On
It also covers all the stuff you'll never think about (until it breaks):

**Infrastructure**
- High-speed Vercel hosting
- Daily backups & restore
- SSL security certificate
- Domain name renewal (.co.nz)

**Human Support**
- Unlimited "Text Us" updates
- Tech fixes when things break
- Real humans in Northland
- No chatbots, no runarounds

### Closing Line
Think of it like rates for your digital property. You pay to keep it maintained, secure, and looking fresh.

---

## SECTION: The 3-Year Rot Cycle

### Headline
The "3-Year Rot" Cycle (The Old Way)

Most businesses get stuck in an expensive rebuild loop. Here's how it works:

### The Old Way (Red Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $5,000 for a new site.
**Year 2:** Site starts looking dated.
**Year 3:** Site is broken/old. You're embarrassed to share it.
**Year 4:** Pay $5,000 again for a new site.

**Total Cost Over 6 Years:** $15,000+
Plus stress. Plus downtime.

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $995 + GST setup. Site goes live in 5 days.
**Year 2:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 3:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 4:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.

**Total Rebuild Fees:** $0
Your monthly fee already covers it.

### Closing Statement
**The math is undeniable.**

You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.

---

## SECTION: Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

### Headline
Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

Most web designers build a site, then ghost you.

### Your Website Is Alive
Your website is alive. It needs:
- **Security updates** (weekly)
- **Performance tweaks** (ongoing)
- **Hosting** (always on)
- **The odd fix** when something breaks
- **A refresh** before it starts looking old

### The Problem with Pay-Per-Fix
If you're paying per fix, you either:

A) Get stuck with a broken site you can't afford to fix
B) Overpay for simple changes

### The Solution
**Subscription fixes this. It's predictable. It's fair.**

And because it's a regular monthly expense, your accountant can generally claim it back — unlike a big upfront agency fee.

Think of it like your phone plan vs. paying per text.

---

## SECTION: The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

### Headline
The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We build your site. You see the preview.
**If you don't love it, we refund you.**

(Minus hard costs: ~3% Stripe fees + domain if purchased. You get back ~93-94% of your payment).

We've never had to refund anyone. But the option exists because we put our money where our mouth is.

---

## SECTION: What You're Actually Comparing

### Headline
What You're Actually Comparing

Here's what the alternatives actually cost:

### DIY (Wix/Shopify/Squarespace)
- $30–50/mo for tool
- 40+ hours of your time (@ $50/hr = $2,000)
- Still looks generic
- You're the support person

**= $2,600–3,000 + your sanity**

### Traditional Agency
- $5,000–15,000 upfront (big cash hit)
- $100–250/hr for changes
- 6–12 week build time
- Abandoned after launch — rebuild in 3 years

**= $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years**

### YourHQ
- $995 + GST setup (live in 5 days)
- $149/mo + GST (includes your next refresh)
- Claimable as a business expense
- **You own it. We handle it. Forever.**

**Professional build + 2 years support = $4,573 + GST**

That's less than half what most agencies charge just to build it — and your accountant can claim it.

## SECTION: Pricing Questions (FAQ)

### Section Title
Pricing Questions

### FAQ 1: What does a website cost in New Zealand?
Professional website costs in NZ range from $700 to $15,000+ depending on complexity and who builds it. YourHQ offers three packages: The Starter ($695 + GST setup + $49/mo + GST) for basic one-page sites, The Launch ($995 + GST + $149/mo + GST) for 5-page professional sites, and The Growth ($1,495 + GST + $249/mo + GST) for full-featured sites with booking systems.

### FAQ 2: What's included in the monthly fee?
The monthly fee covers unlimited text and photo updates, high-speed hosting on Vercel, SSL security, daily backups, domain renewal, tech support when things break, and an annual design refresh (valued at $2,000). Think of it as pre-paying for your next website — when your 12-month anniversary comes around, your refresh is already covered. No surprise invoices.

### FAQ 3: Is the monthly fee tax deductible?
Generally, yes. Because it's a regular monthly subscription (like your phone bill or Xero), your accountant can usually claim it as a business expense. This is simpler than a big upfront agency fee, which often needs to be depreciated over time. Check with your accountant for your specific situation, but most business owners find this structure more tax-friendly.

### FAQ 4: Do you work with clients outside Northland?
Yes! We're based in Northland but work with businesses across all of New Zealand—Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Queenstown, and everywhere in between. All communication happens via text, phone, and email, so location doesn't matter. We've built sites for clients nationwide.

### FAQ 5: Can I cancel anytime?
Yes. All packages are month-to-month with no lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. You own all content and can export your site. The subscription covers hosting, maintenance, and updates—not ownership.

### FAQ 6: Is this cheaper than hiring a traditional agency?
Yes, significantly. Traditional NZ agencies charge $5,000–$15,000 upfront, then $100–$250/hour for updates, often totaling $10,000–$20,000 over two years. YourHQ charges $995 + GST setup + $149/month + GST = $4,573 + GST over two years, including unlimited updates and annual refreshes. That's less than half the cost with better ongoing support — and it's easier to claim as a business expense.

**Time Required:** 15 Mins
No writing. No forms.

### Step 02: We Raid Your Content
We go hunting on your Facebook, Instagram, and Google Reviews to find photos and info.

Most businesses already have 90% of the content they need — it's just scattered. We gather it.

**Time Required:** 0 Mins
We do this ourselves.

### Step 03: The Factory Build
Days 1-4. We build your site using Astro + Tailwind CSS (Silicon Valley tech).

**Features:**
- Under 1 second load time
- Mobile-first design
- SEO Fundamentals

**Action:** We Build
You run your business.

### Step 04: The Preview (Day 5)
We send you a private link. You view it on your phone.

**If you want changes:** We make them in 24 hours.
**If you hate it:** We refund you (minus ~3% processing fees).

**Decision:** Love/Hate
Refund if you hate it.

### Step 05: You Go Live
We flip the switch. Your domain is live. Google is notified.

You get back to work. We become the caretakers.

## OUR STORY PAGE (our-story.astro)

### Page Title
Two Mates.
One Mission.

**Subtitle:**
Friends first. Business partners second. Here to help you own your digital space.

---

## SECTION 1: How YourHQ Started

### Headline
How YourHQ Started
-

### Opening
Here's a stat that stuck in my head from my entrepreneurship studies: only 50% of small to medium businesses in New Zealand have a website.

**Half. In 2025.**

### Body Copy
And I kept thinking about it. Especially as I watched friends build up these incredible profiles on Instagram and Facebook — years of work, thousands of followers, their whole customer base — and then poof. Banned. Hacked. Algorithm changed. Everything gone.

All that work. All those contacts. Just... vanished.

### Quote Box
"I'm also the kind of person who checks websites before I hire anyone. If I'm picking between two tradies and one's got a beautiful website? I go with that tradie. Every time. It's not rational — but it's real."

### The Mission
So when I started learning to code and building AI systems for my Master's, I kept coming back to this question: **How do I create something that actually gets these business owners online?** Not another DIY tool they'll never finish. A system that does the hard part for them.

### Dad's Story
**And honestly? I think about my dad.**

He ran a small business — *Maungi Tanks*. He's not with us anymore. But I imagine what it would've been like to build him a website. To see his face when he saw himself on the internet for the first time.

He would have loved it. It would have made him proud.

### Mission Statement Box
**That's why YourHQ exists.**

For the tradies. The salon owners. The consultants. The small business people who are brilliant at what they do — but never got around to the website part.

I want to give them what I wish I could've given my dad.

---

## SECTION 2 & 3: Meet The Team

### Section Title
Meet The Team

### Lian - Founder & Lead Developer

**What I bring:**
I've spent 15 years helping people communicate better — building learning experiences, designing systems, translating complexity into clarity.

When I started building AI agents for my Master's research, I accidentally taught myself to code. Then I had a thought: If I can build web apps... why not build websites?

Turns out, I loved it. The problem-solving. The logic puzzles. Taking someone's story and translating it exactly into digital form.

**What I bring:**
Silicon Valley infrastructure with Pacific warmth. I handle the builds, the tech, the design — and making sure your website actually sounds like you.

---

### Nic - Business Development Manager

I'm Nic — your first point of contact and biggest cheerleader.

**Here's the thing: I didn't just join YourHQ. I used YourHQ.**

When Lian asked if I'd pilot the service, I'd spent that morning wrestling with Wix, drowning in templates and decisions. Then she asked me a few questions, went away, and built me a website that actually looked like my business.

I nearly cried. Building a website was my barrier to market — the thing holding me back from launching my dream. And just like that, the blocker was gone. Now I'm here to help you do the same.

**What I bring:**
I'm not a pushy salesperson. I'm someone who listens, understands where you're coming from, and helps you figure out if this is right for you. Think of me as a friendly guide who happens to believe in this service because it changed my own trajectory.

---

## SECTION 4: Friends First. Always.

### Headline
Friends First. Always.

### Body Copy
We've been mates for over 12 years.

We've played rugby together. We've raised kids the same age. We've been each other's hype girls through every wild idea, every hard season, every "what if I just..." conversation.

The kind of friends who don't need to talk every day, but when we get together, it feels like yesterday.

When Lian knew she needed someone to handle the people side of YourHQ — someone who could walk into any room and make everyone feel at ease — Nic was the only person she asked.

**Not because we wanted to work together.**
**Because we trust each other completely.**

### Closing Box
**And that's what you get when you work with us:**

Two people who genuinely care. Who've been in the small business hustle ourselves. Who want to see you thrive — not just sell you something.

---

## SECTION 5: The Best of Both Worlds

### Headline
The Best of Both Worlds

### With Lian
You get someone who obsesses over getting your message right. Who builds infrastructure that works while you sleep. Who won't rest until your website actually sounds like you.

### With Nic
You get someone who makes you feel heard. Who answers your questions without jargon. Who you'll walk away from thinking, "I think I just made a new friend."

### Closing
**We're not a faceless agency.**

We're two Kiwis who believe you deserve to own your digital space.

And we're pretty good at making that happen.
