## HOMEPAGE (index.astro)

### Announcement Bar
🚀 Taking bookings for week of Dec 15

### Hero Badge
Based in Aotearoa NZ — Working Globally

### Hero Headline
Stop Renting.
Start Owning.

### Hero Subheadline
You built your business with your own hands. You've done the late nights and the hard mahi.

**So why are you paying rent to Instagram?**

### Hero Description
Professional websites for Kiwi businesses. Built in 5 business days. Managed forever. From $695.

### Hero CTAs
- Start Your Build
- How It Works

## SECTION: The Truth

### Headline
You're Building Your
Castle on Rented Land.

### Body Copy
Here's what nobody tells you:

- If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
- If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
- If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?

### Callout Box
**Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.**

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

**It's time to become an Owner.**

---

## SECTION: Digital Handshake

### Headline
Your Handshake Is Firm.
Your Work Is Solid.
But Your Website?

### Body Copy
In person, you're the real deal. You have presence. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.

But then someone Googles you... And they find nothing. Or worse — a broken website from 2012.

**There's a disconnect.**

Your website is your Digital Handshake. It's the first thing people experience before they meet you.

### Footer Note
// If the carpet doesn't match the drapes? People notice.

## SECTION: Who We Built This For

### Section Title
Who We Built This For

### Card 1: The Tradies
**Category:** Electricians / Plumbers / Builders

**The Pain:**
You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. The last thing you want is to spend hours figuring out Wix.

**The Fix:**
A site that ranks locally on Google and gets the phone ringing. No homework required.

### Card 2: The Creatives
**Category:** Salons / Tattoo / Artists

**The Pain:**
You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings and people to find your prices.

**The Fix:**
A beautiful portfolio site that you actually own. Instagram can go down tomorrow — you're still standing.

### Card 3: The Professionals
**Category:** Consultants / Legal / Coaches

**The Pain:**
You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.

**The Fix:**
A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.

### Section Headline
Live in 5 Days.
No Homework.

**Badge:** NO TYPING REQUIRED

### Step 02: The Factory Build
We build it in 5 days using Astro & Tailwind CSS (Silicon Valley tech). It loads instantly, ranks high, and is impossible to hack.

**Badges:**

## SECTION: Testimonials

**— Nicolette, Ember & Ice**

## SECTION: The Last Website You'll Ever Buy

### Headline
The Last Website
You'll Ever Buy.

### Body Copy
Most websites rot.

They look great on Day 1, but three years later, they look tired.
Then you have to pay another $5,000 to rebuild it.

### Callout Box (Dark Background)
**Not with YourHQ.**

We include a full design refresh every 12 months.
New fonts, new layout, new vibe.

### Comparison: The Old Way
You pay the setup fee once.
Three years later, you pay it again.
And again. And again.

### Comparison: The YourHQ Way
You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.
**Total Rebuild Fees: $0**

## SECTION: The Caretaker Model

### Headline
The Caretaker Model (Not an Agency)

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
✓ We build it (5 days)
✓ We host it (forever)
✓ We fix it (when it breaks)
✓ We refresh it (once a year, free)

### Closing Line
You focus on your business. We keep the digital HQ running.

## SECTION: The 3-Year Rot Cycle

### Headline
The "3-Year Rot" Cycle (The Old Way)

Most businesses get stuck in an expensive rebuild loop. Here's how it works:

### The Old Way (Red Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $5,000 for a new site.
**Year 2:** Site starts looking dated.
**Year 3:** Site is broken/old. You're embarrassed to share it.
**Year 4:** Pay $5,000 again for a new site.

**Total Cost Over 6 Years:** $15,000+
Plus stress. Plus downtime.

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $995 setup. Site goes live in 5 days.
**Year 2:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 3:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 4:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.

**Total Rebuild Fees:** $0
Just the monthly caretaker fee.

### Closing Statement
**The math is undeniable.**

You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.

---

## SECTION: Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

### Headline
Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

Most web designers build a site, then ghost you.

### Your Website Is Alive
Your website is alive. It needs:
- **Security updates** (weekly)
- **Performance tweaks** (ongoing)
- **Hosting** (always on)
- **The odd fix** when something breaks

### The Problem with Pay-Per-Fix
If you're paying per fix, you either:

A) Get stuck with a broken site you can't afford to fix
B) Overpay for simple changes

### The Solution
**Subscription fixes this. It's predictable. It's fair.**

Think of it like your phone plan vs. paying per text.

---

## SECTION: The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

### Headline
The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We build your site. You see the preview.
**If you don't love it, we refund you.**

(Minus hard costs: ~3% Stripe fees + domain if purchased. You get back ~93-94% of your payment).

We've never had to refund anyone. But the option exists because we put our money where our mouth is.

---

## SECTION: What You're Actually Comparing

### Headline
What You're Actually Comparing

**WHY $995 + $149/MO ISN'T CHEAP. IT'S FAIR.**

Here's what the alternatives actually cost:

### DIY (Wix/Shopify/Squarespace)
- $30–50/mo for tool
- 40+ hours of your time (@ $50/hr = $2,000)
- Still looks generic
- You're the support person

**= $2,600–3,000 + your sanity**

### Traditional Agency
- $5,000–15,000 setup
- $100–250/hr for changes
- 6–12 week build time
- You're often abandoned after launch

**= $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years**

### YourHQ
- $995 setup (5 days)
- $149/mo (forever support + annual refresh)
- First 2 years = $4,573
- **You own it. We handle it.**

**Professional build + 2 years support = $4,573**

That's less than half what most agencies charge just to build it.

How We Build Your
Digital HQ in 5 Days.

No forms to fill out. No tech jargon. No homework.
Just one phone call and we handle the rest.

---

## THE PROCESS (TIMELINE)

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview
You hate writing "About Us" pages. So don't. Call our AI Voice Agent while driving home or having a coffee.

**The AI asks:**
- "What do you actually do?"
- "Who are your customers?"
- "What makes you different?"

**Time Required:** 15 Mins
No writing. No forms.

### Step 02: We Raid Your Content
We go hunting on your Facebook, Instagram, and Google Reviews to find photos and info.

Most businesses already have 90% of the content they need — it's just scattered. We gather it.

**Time Required:** 0 Mins
We do this ourselves.

### Step 03: The Factory Build
Days 1-4. We build your site using Astro + Tailwind CSS (Silicon Valley tech).

**Features:**
- Under 1 second load time
- Mobile-first design
- SEO Fundamentals

**Action:** We Build
You run your business.

### Step 04: The Preview (Day 5)
We send you a private link. You view it on your phone.

**If you want changes:** We make them in 24 hours.
**If you hate it:** We refund you (minus ~3% processing fees).

**Decision:** Love/Hate
Refund if you hate it.

### Step 05: You Go Live
We flip the switch. Your domain is live. Google is notified.

You get back to work. We become the caretakers.

## OUR STORY PAGE (our-story.astro)

### Page Title
The Accidental
Web Developer.

**Subtitle:**
Or: What Happens When a Storyteller Falls in Love With Code

---

## NARRATIVE PART 1: The Journey

### Introduction
Kia ora, I'm Lian and I've spent 15 years helping people communicate better. Building learning experiences. Designing systems. Translating complexity into clarity. But I never thought I'd be building websites.

Here's how it actually happened.

### The Wix Era (aka "This Should Be Easy, Right?")
Like most people, I started with Wix. Drag, drop, done. Except it wasn't done. It never looked quite right. The templates felt generic. And every time I wanted something specific, I'd hit a wall. But hey, at least I had a website.

### The WordPress Year (aka "I Can Learn Anything")
Then I thought, "Right. WordPress. That's what the professionals use." So I taught myself WordPress. Spent a year getting comfortable with themes, plugins, and that particular brand of frustration that comes with trying to customize something that really doesn't want to be customized.

It was better. But still... not quite there.

### The Canva Pivot (aka "Wait, Canva Does Websites Now?")
When Canva launched websites, I was intrigued. As someone who already loved Canva for design, it seemed like the perfect middle ground. Quick. Visual. Easy to update.

And for a while, it was great. But I kept bumping into the same limitation: I could make it look nice, but I couldn't make it do what I actually needed it to do.

---

## NARRATIVE PART 2: The Pivot

### The Plot Twist: Learning to Code
Here's where things got interesting.

I was building AI agents for my Master's research—voice assistants, automated systems, tools to help businesses scale without losing their humanity. I needed these agents to talk to websites, to collect data, to integrate with systems.

So I learned to code. Not to build websites. To build infrastructure.

But then I had this thought: "If I can build web apps... why not try building an actual website?"

### The Moment Everything Changed (Callout Box)
I'm a storyteller. It's what I've always done—taking complex ideas and turning them into something people can see themselves in. Something that moves them to action.

When I started coding my own sites, something clicked.

For the first time, I could take a message—a real human message—and translate it exactly into digital form. No templates. No compromises. Just pure translation: from heart to code to screen.

And I absolutely loved it. The problem-solving. The logic puzzles. The satisfaction of making something work. As someone who thrives on learning and growth (it's literally my top value), coding felt like coming home.

### The Pilot Programme (aka "The Joy on Their Faces")
I started building websites for small business owners I knew. People like my dad, who ran a small business and was brilliant at the work but frustrated by the admin. People like my husband, who's in the trades. Real people doing real work.

I'd sit down with them, listen to their story, understand their business. Then I'd go away and build them something that felt authentically them.

When I delivered those websites, the reactions floored me.

- "This is exactly us."
- "How did you know?"
- "This feels like me, but better."

**That joy—that moment when someone sees themselves properly represented online for the first time—that's what hooked me.**

---

## NARRATIVE PART 3: The Mission & Bio

### The Coffee Shop Revelation
One day I was having coffee in Whangārei, scrolling through my phone, checking in on local businesses I loved. The baker who makes the best sourdough. The builder who renovated our house. The café where I'm writing this.

And I realised: most of them were in a digital void.

Living on Facebook. Or Instagram. Or both. Entirely at the mercy of algorithms they couldn't control. One platform policy change away from losing their entire digital presence.

These were businesses that had been around for 20 years. Businesses with loyal customers, excellent reputations, real value to offer. But online? They were tenants. Not owners.

**And I thought: This isn't right.**

### The Mission: From Tenants to Owners
That's when YourHQ was born.

I want to make owning your own space online accessible for small to medium businesses in Aotearoa. Not renting space on someone else's platform. Not being subject to someone else's rules. Owning your digital home.

My mission is simple: translate you—and your business—into YourHQ online.

When someone sees your website, reads your content, and then meets you in person, I want them to feel like your website was a real, authentic representation of you. Not a template. Not a cookie-cutter design. You.

### Why I'm Qualified to Do This (Beyond the Obvious)
Yes, I can code. Yes, I understand AI and automation and all the technical stuff.

But here's what really matters: I'm studying Technological Futures. I'm fascinated by where technology is taking us and how we can make our digital experiences richer, more meaningful, more human.

And I'm a storyteller through and through. Someone who prides herself on the ability to turn information into story—authentic, honest, engaging.

### Closing Callout
**That combination? That's what makes YourHQ different.**

I bring Silicon Valley infrastructure with Pacific hospitality. Code with conversation. Technical precision with genuine warmth.

Because at the end of the day, your website isn't just a digital brochure. It's the bridge between your business and your customers. Between who you are and who you're meant to serve.

And that bridge deserves to be built properly.

## SECTION: What This Means for You

### Headline
What This Means for You

### Body Copy
If you're a small or medium business owner in New Zealand, tired of:

✕ Being in an algorithmic void
✕ Fighting with website builders that don't quite work
✕ Feeling like your online presence doesn't represent who you really are
✕ Spending hours on tech when you should be doing what you're actually good at

**Then YourHQ might be for you.**

### Closing Paragraph
I don't just build websites. I translate your business into digital form. I create infrastructure that works while you sleep. And I make sure that when someone lands on your site, they meet you—not some generic template version of you.

Because you deserve to own your digital space.
And I've learned just enough code to make that happen.
