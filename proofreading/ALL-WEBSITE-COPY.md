## SECTION: The Truth (You're Brilliant)

### Headline
You're Brilliant at What You Do.
But Online? It's Messy.

### Body Copy
You can be the best in town — years of experience, great word-of-mouth, solid reviews.

But when someone goes to check you out, they hit one of these:

- No website (so they move on)
- Something old and broken
- A Facebook page that hasn't been updated in years
- An Instagram that looks good… but doesn't help them take the next step

And here's the part that stings:

**Your work is premium. Your online presence looks optional.**

### Callout Box
**This is the "Google Test."**

When someone's choosing between you and a competitor, they Google both names. One of you looks established. One of you looks like a risk.

### Closing
And it's not because you're not good.
It's because you're busy — and the website thing is a pain.

---

## SECTION: Digital Handshake

### Headline
In Person, You're Solid.
Online… It Should Match.

### Body Copy
People don't hire you from your website.
They hire you from *what they feel* after checking you out.

In real life, you're the real deal — reputation, experience, trust.

But online? If it looks messy or outdated, people hesitate.

### Key Statement
**Your website is your digital handshake.**
It should feel firm. Clean. Professional. Like you've got your act together.

### Footer Note
// First impressions still matter — especially when money's on the line.

---

## SECTION: Rented Land

### Headline
Plus, You Don't Even Own It.

### Body Copy
Instagram and Facebook are great tools — but they're not home.

If the algorithm changes, your reach drops.
If your account gets hacked, your whole presence can disappear.
And you can't export your followers like they're yours — because they're not.

### Callout Box
**Right now, most business owners are Digital Tenants.**

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord can change them anytime.

**A website is how you become an Owner.**

## SECTION: Who We Built This For

### Section Title
Who We Built This For

### Section Subtitle
If you're good at what you do but sick of the online side feeling messy — you're our people.

### Card 1: The Tradies
**Category:** Electricians / Plumbers / Builders

**The Pain:**
You're flat out. You don't want another admin job. And you're not spending 40 hours "learning Wix."

**The Fix:**
A site that gets you found locally, looks legit, and makes it dead-easy for people to call or request a quote.

**Link:** Learn More for Tradies →

### Card 2: The Creatives
**Category:** Salons / Tattoo / Artists

**The Pain:**
Your Instagram looks beautiful… but it doesn't run your bookings. And it doesn't help new clients trust you fast.

**The Fix:**
A portfolio + booking-ready website you actually own — so clients can browse, trust, and book without back-and-forth DMs.

### Card 3: The Professionals
**Category:** Consultants / Legal / Coaches

**The Pain:**
You can do the work — but you need to *look established* to win contracts. Right now, you're losing to people who simply appear more credible online.

**The Fix:**
A corporate-grade site that passes the Google Test, builds authority, and makes it obvious you're the safe choice.

### Closing Line
No matter what kind of business you run, the goal is the same: **get you online properly — without adding more work to your plate.**

The Last Website

## SECTION: FAQ (Homepage)

### Section Title
Common Questions

### FAQ 1: How much does a small business website cost in NZ?
Professional websites in NZ typically cost $2,000–$5,000 upfront with agencies, plus ongoing fees. YourHQ's Launch package is $995 + GST setup / $149 + GST/month — includes unlimited updates and annual design refresh. Starter starts at $695 + GST setup.

### FAQ 2: How quickly can my website go live?
5 business days once we have everything we need. One 15-minute phone chat, plus any photos or logos you want included. No meetings, no homework.

### FAQ 3: Do you build websites outside Auckland?
Yes. Based in Whangārei, servicing all of NZ. All communication via text and phone.

### FAQ 4: What makes YourHQ different from Wix or Squarespace?
With Wix or Squarespace, you do all the work yourself — 40+ hours of building, learning, and troubleshooting. With YourHQ, we do everything for you in 5 days. Plus you get unlimited updates and annual refreshes included.

### FAQ 5: Will my website help me rank on Google and voice search?
Yes. Fast load times, mobile-first design, local business schema. You show up when people search "electrician near me."

### FAQ 6: Do you set up Google Maps for me?
Yes. We claim your listing, write your description, upload photos, and connect it to your website. If you already have a listing, we'll give recommendations on how to optimise it.

## SECTION: Real Talk FAQ

### Section Title
Real Talk
The questions you're actually thinking

### Real Talk 1: "My nephew can build me a website for free."
Will he be around when it breaks at 11pm? Will he refresh it in 3 years? If it doesn't work out, give us a call.

### Real Talk 2: "I've been burned by web designers before."
'Love Your Launch' guarantee: Preview on Day 5. Don't love it? Full refund.
*(Your setup fee back, minus ~3% processing + any domain costs.)*

### Real Talk 3: "I don't have time for this right now."
Total time from you: one 15-minute phone call. We grab everything else from your socials.

### Real Talk 4: "It seems too cheap. What's the catch?"
We use a productised model — same site type, same process, every time. Some agencies charge $10–15k for bespoke work. We've streamlined it.

## SECTION: What You're Actually Comparing (Table Format)

### Headline
What You're Actually Comparing

### Sub-headline
The real cost isn't dollars — it's time, stress, and what it costs you to look invisible.

| | DIY (Wix) | Agency | YourHQ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront Cost** | $0 | $5,000–15,000 | **$995 + GST** |
| **Monthly Cost** | $30–50 | $0–250/update | **$149 + GST** |
| **Your Time** | 40+ hours | 6–12 weeks | **15 minutes** |
| **Updates** | You do it | Pay per change | **Unlimited included** |
| **2-Year Total** | $2,500+ (your time) | $8,000–20,000 | **$4,573 + GST** |

YourHQ: Less than half agency cost, with ongoing care included.

*Time estimates vary, but most DIY sites take weeks of "after hours" and still don't feel finished.*

## SECTION: Why We Do Subscription

### Headline
Why We Do Subscription

### Body Copy
Websites aren't "set and forget."
They need:

- Hosting
- Security updates
- Performance tweaks
- Fixes when something breaks
- Content updates as your business changes

### The Problem with Pay-Per-Fix
Pay-per-fix leads to broken sites you can't justify repairing — or overpriced invoices for small changes.

**Subscription = predictable. Fair. Sorted.**

---

## SECTION: The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

### Headline
The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We send you a private preview link on Day 5.
**Don't love it? Full refund.**

Your setup fee back, minus payment processing (~3%)
and any domain costs already registered for you.

## SECTION: The Problem

### Headline
You're Flat Out on the Tools.
So Why Does It Still Feel Like Money's Slipping Through?

### Body Copy
Here's what happens every day: Someone needs a tradie. They grab their phone and search: "[trade] + near me" or "[trade] + [suburb]".

Google shows a short list. They call the one that looks legit.

If your online presence is messy — or you're not showing up at all — you don't even get a chance.

### Callout Box
**Most Customers Trust a Website More Than Social Media**

When someone's choosing between you and another tradie, they Google both names. One of you looks established. One of you looks like a risk.

**Which one are you?**

---

## SECTION: Old Mate Dave Test

### Headline
Be Honest: Would You Hire a Tradie With No Website?

### Body Copy
Even if Dave recommends a plumber, you're still going to Google them first. If you find: no website, an outdated one, or a dodgy page from years ago …you hesitate.

Your customers are doing the same thing to you. Right now.

**Total time from you: one 15-minute phone call.**

## SECTION: The Math

### Headline
The Math That Matters

### Body Copy
You don't need 100 new leads. You need the right people to find you — and trust you — when they're ready to spend.

- Average job value (varies, but often): **$1,000–$5,000**
- Even one extra job a month: **$12k–$60k/yr**
- YourHQ cost (Launch): **$995 setup + $149/mo**

**Payback: one decent job can cover the whole first year.**

We can't promise you'll rank #1 overnight — it depends on your area and competition. But we build sites that load fast, look legit, and help you show up more clearly on Google.

---

## SECTION: Get Found on Google Maps

### Headline
Most Tradie Work Starts on Google Maps.
Are You Even On There?

### Body Copy
Someone needs a tradie. They search **"electrician near me."** Google shows the map pack — usually 3 businesses. If you're not in that mix, you're invisible.

**We put you on the map. Literally.**

We set up (or tidy up) your Google Maps listing and link it properly to your website — so when people search in your area, you show up like a real business.

### What's Included:
✓ Claim & verify your Google Maps listing (where needed)
✓ Write your business description
✓ Upload job photos
✓ Set your service areas
✓ Link to your website
✓ Basic optimisation so it actually works for you

## SECTION: Why We Exist

### Headline
Based in Whangārei. Built for Tradies Who Don't Have Time for This Stuff.

Half of NZ small businesses still don't have a website. Not because they're lazy — because they're busy.

DIY tools take weeks of after-hours stress. Agencies charge $10–15k and move slow. We built YourHQ for tradies who just want it sorted: fast build, no homework, ongoing support, and a website that doesn't rot.

---

## SECTION: FAQ (Tradies Page)

### Section Title
Yeah, But...

### FAQ 1: "I'm already fully booked. Why do I need a website?"
So you can choose better work — not just more work. A good site helps you look premium, attract higher-quality enquiries, and charge accordingly.

### FAQ 2: "I don't have time for this."
You don't need time. Total input from you: one 15-minute call. We handle the rest.

### FAQ 3: "My nephew can build me one for free."
Will he be around when it breaks? Will he update it? Will he keep it secure and fast? Free websites often get expensive later.

### FAQ 4: "Websites are expensive."
Some agencies charge $10–15k and disappear. We charge $995 + GST and stay on as caretakers.

### FAQ 5: "Will this help me show up on Google Maps?"
Yes — we set up or optimise your Google Maps listing and connect it properly to your site. Results vary by area, but most businesses start seeing improvement over time as Google re-indexes.

### FAQ 6: "I already have a Google listing but it's a mess. Can you fix it?"
Yes. If it's claimed, we optimise it. If it's unclaimed, we help get it sorted.

### FAQ 7: "How do I get more Google reviews?"
On Growth, we include a review collection system. On Launch, we'll still point you in the right direction to make it easy for customers to leave reviews.

One 15-minute call — we handle the rest.

---

## SECTION: The Promise

### Headline
This Should Feel Like Relief.

### Body Copy
Most business owners don't need "a website project." They need the website problem *gone*. So we built a process that's fast, simple, and doesn't steal your evenings.

**Your total time: 15 minutes.**

---

## SECTION: The Process (Timeline)

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview
**Time Required:** 15 Minutes

Call us for a quick chat while you're driving home (or between jobs). Hands-free, records automatically, captures everything we need — your services, your story, your tone. No typing. No forms. No awkward meetings.

**Badge:** No writing. No forms.

### Step 02: We Pull the Pieces Together
**Time Required:** 0 Minutes

We gather what we need from your existing footprint: photos, reviews, logos, socials, business details. If you've got a logo or a few favourite photos you want included — sweet, send them. If not, we'll work with what's already there and make it look intentional.

**Badge:** Zero homework.

### Step 03: The Factory Build
**Action:** Days 1–4: We Build

We build your full website — structure, design, copy, mobile layout, SEO basics — the whole lot. Fast load times. Clean design. Easy for customers to call, enquire, or book.

**Google Maps Setup Included (Launch + Growth)**
We set up or optimise your Google Maps listing and connect it properly to your site — so you're ready to be found.

**Badges:**
- Under 1 second load
- Mobile first
- SEO & AEO ready
- Google Maps ready

**Badge:** You run your business.

### Step 04: The Preview (Day 5)
**Decision:** Love It / Tweak It / Refund It

On Day 5, we send you a private preview link. Want changes? We sort them quickly. Don't love it? You can request a full refund of your setup fee before go-live.

(Minus ~3% processing + any domain costs.)

**Badge:** Refund if you hate it.

### Step 05: You Go Live

We flip the switch. Your site goes live. And here's the part most designers don't do: **We stay.**

- **New service?** Text us.
- **New photos from a job?** Text us.

## OUR STORY PAGE (our-story.astro)

### Page Header
Founder-led.
Built in Whangārei.

**Subtitle:** We help Kiwi business owners own their digital space — without the homework.

## SECTION 1: Why YourHQ Exists

### Label
The Problem

### Headline
Why YourHQ Exists

### Body Copy
YourHQ exists because too many brilliant small business owners are doing everything right… except the online part.

Not because they don't care — because they're busy.

And the options out there are rough:
- DIY tools that turn into a months-long after-hours project
- Agencies that cost a fortune, take forever, and often disappear after launch

So I built a system that makes this feel like relief:

**Websites built fast. Kept sorted. Looked after long-term.**
Built in 5 days. No homework. No tech jargon.

---

## SECTION 2: The Google Test

### Label
The Truth

### Headline
The Google Test Is Real.

### Body Copy
When someone's choosing between two businesses, they Google both names.

One looks established. One looks risky.

It's not fair — but it's real.

### Callout Box
YourHQ exists to make sure your online presence matches the quality of your work — so you don't lose jobs to businesses that simply look bigger online.

---

## SECTION 3: How It Started

### Label
Origin

### Headline
How It Started

### Body Copy
I started learning to code while doing my Master's and kept coming back to one question:

**How do we get busy, capable business owners online — properly — without adding more work to their plate?**

Most people don't need "a website project." They need the website problem gone.

So I productised the process:
- One short phone chat
- We pull what we need from your existing footprint
- We build it in 5 days
- Then we stay on as caretakers so it doesn't rot

**That's the whole model.**

---

## SECTION 4: What We Care About

### Label
Values

### Headline
What We Care About

### Body Copy
We're not here to impress other designers. We're here to help you win.

That means:
- **No homework** — you're not writing website copy at midnight
- **No ghosting** — we stay on after launch
- **Ownership** — you own your domain, content, and design from day one
- **Care** — your site stays fast, current, and looked after

---

## SECTION 5: Meet The Team

### Section Title
Meet The Team

### Lian - Founder & Lead Developer

I own YourHQ and lead the builds — strategy, copy, design, infrastructure, performance.

If it's on your site, I'm accountable for it.

**What I bring:**
A calm, capable process that turns your story into a website that feels like you — and works while you sleep.

---

### Nic - Client Partnerships & First Contact

Nic is your first point of contact — questions, pricing, bookings, and making sure the process feels simple from day one.

She'll help you figure out which package fits, and she'll keep you out of the weeds.

**What she brings:**
Clarity, warmth, and straight answers — without the jargon.

## SECTION 1: The Problem (From your side of the desk)

### Headline
The Problem
(From your side of the desk)

You see it all the time:

The tradie doing great work but losing jobs because they don't show up on Google.

The salon owner whose whole business lives on Instagram.

The consultant who's solid — but fails the "Google Test."

**They ask you for advice. You tell them they need a website. Then comes the awkward part: who do you send them to?**

### Problem Cards:

**Option A: Wix / DIY**
40 hours of your client's time, frustration, and usually no finished result.

**Option B: Agencies**
Big money ($5k+) and long delays — often overkill for what they actually need.

**Option C: Doing Nothing**
Means having the exact same conversation again next quarter.

### Solution Pop:
**That's the gap the YourHQ Network fills.**

---

## SECTION 2: What We Do

### Headline

## SECTION: FAQ (NZ Website Design)

### Section Title
Common Questions

### FAQ 1: Do you only work with businesses in Northland?
No! We're based in Northland but work with businesses across all of New Zealand—Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Queenstown, and everywhere in between. All communication happens via text, phone, and email, so your location doesn't matter. We optimize your site for local SEO in your specific city or region.

### FAQ 2: How do you optimize for local search in my city?
We implement local business schema markup with your specific location, optimize your content for local keywords (e.g., "electrician Wellington" or "salon Christchurch"), set up your Google Business Profile integration, and ensure fast load times for mobile users searching in your area. This helps you rank for "near me" searches and local service queries.

### FAQ 3: What's the difference between YourHQ and a local web designer?
Local designers often charge $5,000–$15,000 upfront, take 6–12 weeks to build, then disappear after launch. YourHQ delivers in 5 days for $695–$1,495 + GST, includes unlimited updates, provides ongoing support, and gives you a free design refresh every year. Plus, you can cancel anytime—no long-term contracts.

### FAQ 4: Can you help with Google Business Profile setup?
Yes! While we don't manage your Google Business Profile directly, we ensure your website is optimized to support it—consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all pages, local business schema markup, and integration with your GBP listing. This helps you rank higher in local map results.

## SECTION: Privacy Policy Content

### Core Philosophy
YourHQ operates under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020. Beyond legal compliance, our core philosophy is **Data Sovereignty**: We are the caretakers of your digital assets, but you remain the owner.

---

### 1. Information We Collect
To build and maintain your website, we collect:
- **Business Identity:** Name, contact details, and business descriptions.
- **Website Content:** Images, text, logos, and files you upload to our Shared Drive.
- **Voice Data:** Audio recordings from your "Drive-Home Interview" with our AI agent.
- **Technical Data:** Analytics on how your website performs (if on the Growth plan).

### 2. Our Technology Stack & Data Storage
We believe in radical transparency regarding where your data lives. We use best-in-class infrastructure to ensure speed and security.

- **Supabase:** We use Supabase for our database. We implement **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies, meaning your data is cryptographically segregated. Only authorized users (you and our admins) can access your specific records.
- **Stripe:** We use Stripe for all payments. YourHQ never sees or stores your credit card numbers. Stripe adheres to the highest level of PCI Service Provider Level 1 standards.
- **ElevenLabs:** Used for our AI Interview Agent. Your voice data is processed solely to transcribe information for your website build. We do not use your voice to clone your identity.
- **Vercel:** Your website files are hosted on Vercel's global edge network to ensure 99.9% uptime and lightning-fast loading speeds for your customers.

### 3. Data Sovereignty (Ownership)
This is where we differ from platforms like Facebook or Instagram:
- **You own your content.** We claim no intellectual property rights over the text and images you provide.
- **You own your customer list.** Any leads generated by your website belong 100% to you. We do not mine, sell, or share your customer data.
- **Portability.** If you choose to leave YourHQ (after the minimum term), we provide you with a static export of your website files. We do not hold your digital presence hostage.

### 4. How We Use Voice Data
When you speak with our AI Agent (Penny/Lian's Digital Twin):
- The conversation is recorded and transcribed to generate website copy.
- These recordings are stored securely within our private logs.
- We do not share these recordings with third parties for marketing purposes.

### 5. Your Rights
Under the NZ Privacy Act, you have the right to:
- Ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you.
- Ask for it to be corrected if you think it is wrong.
- Request that your data be deleted from our servers (subject to us needing to keep billing records for tax purposes).

### FAQ 3: Can I update the site myself?
**Launch & Growth Plans:** No need! Unlimited updates included—just text us:
- ✓ Text changes (phone, hours, pricing, descriptions)
- ✓ Photo swaps (update your gallery anytime)
- ✓ Content edits (keep your site current)

*Not included: New pages, new integrations, or major scope changes (quoted separately).*

**Starter Plan:** Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.

## TERMS OF TRADE (Plain English)

### 1. Payments
**Setup fees are paid 100% upfront** to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.

### 2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)
We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee **before the site goes live**.

*Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).*

### 3. Liability
We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).
