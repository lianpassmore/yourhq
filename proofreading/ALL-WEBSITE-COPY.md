## SECTION: The Truth

### Headline
You're Building Your
Castle on Rented Land.

### Body Copy
Here's what nobody tells you:

- If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
- If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
- If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?

You have 8,000 Instagram followers. But you can't export them. They're not YOUR followers—they're Instagram's users who happen to follow you.

### Callout Box
**Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.**

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

**It's time to become an Owner.**

---

## SECTION: Digital Handshake

### Headline
Your Handshake Is Firm.
Your Work Is Solid.
But Your Website?

### Body Copy
In person, you're the real deal. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.

But then someone Googles you... and finds a broken website from 2012. Or nothing at all.

Your website is your Digital Handshake.

### Footer Note
// First impressions still matter.

## SECTION: Who We Built This For

### Section Title
Who We Built This For

### Card 1: The Tradies
**Category:** Electricians / Plumbers / Builders

**The Pain:**
You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. Wix isn't happening.

**The Fix:**
A site that gets you found locally. Phone starts ringing. No homework required.

**Link:** Learn More for Tradies →

### Card 2: The Creatives
**Category:** Salons / Tattoo / Artists

**The Pain:**
You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings.

**The Fix:**
A portfolio site you actually own. Platform-proof.

### Card 3: The Professionals
**Category:** Consultants / Legal / Coaches

**The Pain:**
You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.

**The Fix:**
A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.

Common Questions

### FAQ 1: How much does a small business website cost in NZ?
Professional websites in NZ typically cost $2,000–$5,000 upfront with agencies, plus ongoing fees. YourHQ's Launch package is $995 + GST setup / $149 + GST/month — includes unlimited updates and annual design refresh. Starter starts at $695 + GST setup.

### FAQ 5: Will my website help me rank on Google and voice search?

Founding Member Deal: 50% Off Setup + Rate Locked for Life — 26 Spots Only

### Hero Badge
FOR ELECTRICIANS • PLUMBERS • BUILDERS • PAINTERS

### Hero Headline
Stop Losing Jobs to Blokes Who Just Show Up on Google.

### Hero Subhead
You've got 4.8 stars and 15 years experience. But when customers Google "electrician near me"—they find your competitor.

### Hero Body
Professional websites for Kiwi tradies. Built in 5 days. No Wix. No homework. You talk for 15 minutes. We do everything else.

### Hero CTAs
- Get The Deal (50% Off)
- See How It Works

---

## SECTION: The Problem

### Headline
You're Fully Booked.
So Why Does It Feel Like You're Leaving Money on the Table?

### Body Copy
- **46 people** Googled "electrician [your suburb]" this week
- **43 of them** called your competitor
- **You got zero**

That's $5,000-$10,000 walking out the door. Every week. Because you're invisible.

### Callout Box
**Your Facebook Page Isn't Enough**

84% of customers trust a website MORE than social media.

When someone's choosing between you and another tradie, they Google both names. One of you has a professional site. One of you doesn't.

**Which one are you?**

---

## SECTION: Old Mate Dave Test

### Headline
Would You Hire a Tradie With No Website?

### Body Copy
**Be honest.**

If Dave recommended a plumber, you'd still Google him first. Find a dodgy Facebook page from 2019? You'd think twice.

Your customers are doing the same to you. Right now.

**15 minutes on the phone. That's all it takes.**

---

## SECTION: The Process

### Section Headline

### Step 04: You Go Live

---

## SECTION: The Math

### Headline
One Extra Job Per Week = $130,000 Per Year

### Body Copy
**Let's do the maths:**

- Average tradie job: $2,500
- One extra job/week: $130,000/yr
- YourHQ: $995 + GST setup / $149 + GST/month

**Payback: One job.**

We can't guarantee you'll rank #1 tomorrow—that depends on your location and competition. But every tradie we've built for shows up more clearly and gets more calls than before.

## SECTION: Testimonials

### Section Title
"My Mates Reckon It's Banging."

### Main Testimonial

## SECTION: Why We Exist

### Headline
Based in Northland. For Tradies Who Don't Have Time for This Stuff.

Half of NZ small businesses don't have a website. Not because they're lazy—because they're busy.

Two people. Northland-based. We believe tradies deserve to show up on Google without 40 hours on Wix or $15K on an agency.

---

## SECTION: Get Found on Google Maps

### Headline
86% of Kiwis Use Google Maps to Find Tradies.
Are You Even On There?

### Body Copy
Someone needs an electrician. They type **"electrician near me."**

Google shows 3 businesses. If you're not there, you don't exist.

**We put you on the map. Literally.**

Your Google Maps listing gets set up, optimized, and linked to your website. Photos uploaded. Description written. Ready for reviews.

So when someone in your area searches, you show up.

### What's Included:
✓ Claim & verify your Google Maps listing
✓ Write your business description
✓ Upload job photos
✓ Set your service areas
✓ Link to your website
✓ Set you up to collect reviews

---

## SECTION: FAQ (Tradies Page)

### Section Title
Yeah, But...

### FAQ 1: "I'm already fully booked. Why do I need a website?"
A website lets you choose better work, not just more work. Charge premium rates. Say no to nightmare customers.

### FAQ 2: "I don't have time for this."
Total time from you: 15-minute phone call. We do everything else.

### FAQ 3: "My nephew can build me one for free."
Will he be around when it breaks at 11pm? Will he refresh it in 3 years? Will he optimise it for Google?

### FAQ 4: "Websites are expensive."
Some agencies charge $10-15K and disappear. We charge $995 + GST and stay. Can you afford to keep losing jobs to competitors who show up on Google?

### FAQ 5: Will this help me show up on Google Maps?
Yes. Most tradies start appearing in local search within 30-60 days.

### FAQ 6: I already have a Google listing but it's a mess. Can you fix it?
If you've claimed it, we optimise it. If it's unclaimed, we sort it. Ready to bring in leads.

### FAQ 7: How do I get more Google reviews?
We set you up with a simple system. Send customers a link. They click, review, done. Reviews are the #1 factor in Google Maps rankings.

## OUR STORY PAGE (our-story.astro)

### Page Header
Two Mates.
One Mission.

**Subtitle:** Friends first. Business partners second. Here to help you own your digital space.

---

## SECTION 1: How YourHQ Started

### Headline
How YourHQ Started

Here's a stat that stuck: only 53% of small to medium businesses in New Zealand have a website.

**Half. In 2025.**

### Body Copy
I kept thinking about it. I watched friends build up profiles on Instagram and Facebook — years of work, thousands of followers, their whole customer base — and then poof. Banned. Hacked. Algorithm changed. Everything gone.

All that work. All those contacts. Just... vanished.

### Quote Box
"I'm also the kind of person who checks websites before I hire anyone. If I'm picking between two tradies and one's got a beautiful website? I go with that tradie. Every time. It's not rational — but it's real."

### The Mission
When I started learning to code for my Master's, I kept coming back to this question: **How do I actually get these business owners online?** Not another DIY tool they'll never finish. A system that does the hard part for them.

### Dad's Story
**And honestly? I think about my dad.**

He ran a small business — *Maungi Tanks*. He's not with us anymore. But I imagine what it would've been like to build him a website. To see his face when he saw himself on the internet for the first time.

He would have loved it. It would have made him proud.

### Mission Statement Box
**That's why YourHQ exists.**

For the tradies. The salon owners. The consultants. The small business people who are brilliant at what they do — but never got around to the website part.

I want to give them what I wish I could've given my dad.

## SECTION 2 & 3: Meet The Team

### Section Title
Meet The Team

### Lian - Founder & Lead Developer

15 years helping people communicate better — building learning experiences, designing systems, translating complexity into clarity.

When I started building AI agents for my Master's, I accidentally taught myself to code. If I can build web apps... why not build websites?

Taking someone's story and translating it into digital form.

**What I bring:**
Enterprise infrastructure. I handle the builds, the tech, the design — making sure your website sounds like you.

---

### Nic - Business Development Manager

I'm Nic — your first point of contact.

**I didn't just join YourHQ. I used YourHQ.**

Lian asked that morning — I'd been wrestling with Wix. She asked me a few questions, went away, and built me a website that looked like my business.

Building a website was my barrier to market. Blocker gone. Now I'm here to help you do the same.

**What I bring:**
I listen, understand where you're coming from, and help you figure out if this is right for you.

---

## SECTION 4: Friends First. Always.

### Headline
Friends First. Always.

Mates for over 12 years.

We've been each other's hype girls through every wild idea, every hard season.

Nic was the only person I asked.

**Because we trust each other completely.**

### Closing Box
**And that's what you get when you work with us:**

Two people who genuinely care. Who want to see you thrive — not just sell you something.

---

## SECTION 5: The Best of Both Worlds

### Headline
The Best of Both Worlds

### With Lian
Obsesses over getting your message right. Builds infrastructure that works while you sleep. Won't rest until your website sounds like you.

### With Nic
Makes you feel heard. Answers questions without jargon.

### Closing
**We're not a faceless agency.**

We're two Kiwis who believe you deserve to own your digital space.

## SECTION: FAQ / The Fine Print

### Headline
The Fine Print

### FAQ 1: Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?
Nope. Refer 12 people, and you don't pay us a cent for a whole year.

### FAQ 2: When do I get my free month?
As soon as your friend pays their setup fee, we credit your account for the next billing cycle.

### FAQ 3: Can I refer myself for a second business?
Nice try! But actually... yes. If you own a second business, we'll treat it as a referral.

## SECTION 1: The Problem (From your side of the desk)

### Headline
The Problem
(From your side of the desk)

You see this all the time. The tradie doing great work but losing jobs to competitors. The salon owner whose whole business lives on Instagram.

**They ask you for advice. You tell them they need a website. Then comes the awkward part.**

### Problem Cards:

**Option A: Wix / DIY**
Means 40 hours of your client's time, frustration, and usually no result.

**Option B: Agencies**
Means big money ($5k+) and long delays. Often overkill for what they need.

**Option C: Doing Nothing**
Means having the exact same conversation next quarter. Your client stays stuck.

### Solution Pop:
**That's the gap the YourHQ Network fills.**

---

## SECTION 2: What We Do

### Headline
Websites for Small Biz.

### Features:

**Built in 5 Days**

**No Homework**
We don't ask clients to write copy. We interview them, pull what we need, and build it.

**Small Biz Pricing**
Setup from **$695**. Ongoing care from **$49/mo**. Not agency pricing. Not DIY pain.

**The Caretaker Model**
We don't build and disappear. We host, maintain, and update the site so it stays current.

### Headline
Why Join The Network?

### Benefits:

**You Look Good**
Your client gets sorted quickly, properly, and without drama. That reflects well on you as their advisor.

**Referrals Flow Both Ways**
Every new client onboarding includes a simple question: *"Who do you trust for accounting, finance, or insurance?"* When your name fits, we send the introduction.

**Practical Tools**
We provide co-branded resources you can actually use — guides and checklists with your logo on them. Helpful, not salesy.

**Credible Network**
Network members are listed on our internal directory and featured when relevant. No black holes. No random hand-offs.

## SECTION 5: The Value Exchange

### Headline
How It Works (Practically)

### Step 01: Join the Network
Send us an email. We'll send you a short welcome kit and get you set up.

### Step 02: Make the Intro
When a client mentions needing a website, just say: *"I'm part of the YourHQ Network. Want me to connect you?"*

### Step 03: We Take Over
We contact them, run the call, build the site, and keep you out of the weeds completely.

### Step 04: Everyone Wins
Your client moves forward. You strengthen the relationship. We grow together.

## SECTION 8: FAQ

### FAQ 1: Do I get paid for referrals?
No. We focus on long-term value exchange, not transactional kickbacks. We reciprocate by sending our clients to you when they need your specific services.

### FAQ 2: What if my client has a bad experience?
We fix it — or refund them. Protecting your trust is non-negotiable. We offer a 'Love Your Launch' guarantee where if they don't like the preview, they get their money back.

### FAQ 3: How do I make a referral?
It's simple. Text or email Nic with their name and number (after getting their permission). We take it from there.

### FAQ 4: Do I need to commit to anything?
No contracts. No minimums. Just refer when it makes sense for your client.

### FAQ 5: Can I refer clients outside Northland?
Yes. While we are based in Whangārei, we work with Kiwi businesses nationwide. Our process is fully remote-capable.

## LEGAL / TERMS & FAQ PAGE (legal.astro)

### Page Title
Terms & FAQ

---

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### FAQ 1: Do I own my website?
Yes. You own the domain name, the content, and the design. If you cancel, we transfer the domain and provide a ZIP file of your site code.

### FAQ 2: What happens if I cancel?
No lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime. We will transfer your domain to your own account and give you your files. However, you will lose the hosting, security updates, and "text us" support.

### FAQ 3: Can I update the site myself?
**Launch & Growth Plans:** No need! Unlimited text/photo updates are included in your monthly fee. Just text us.

**Starter Plan:** Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.

---

## TERMS OF TRADE (Plain English)

### 1. Payments
**Setup fees are paid 100% upfront** to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.

### 2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)
We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee **before the site goes live**.

*Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).*

### 3. Liability
We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).
