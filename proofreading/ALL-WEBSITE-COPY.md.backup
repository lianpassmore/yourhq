## SECTION: The Truth

### Headline
You're Building Your
Castle on Rented Land.

### Body Copy
Here's what nobody tells you:

- If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
- If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
- If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?
- If you're not on Google Maps, do you even exist to the 86% searching "tradie near me"?

### Callout Box
**Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.**
(Even if business is good.)

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

**It's time to become an Owner.**

---

## SECTION: Digital Handshake

### Headline
Your Handshake Is Firm.
Your Work Is Solid.
But Your Website?

### Body Copy
In person, you're the real deal. You have presence. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.

But then someone Googles you... And they find nothing. Or worse — a broken website from 2012.

**There's a disconnect.**

Your website is your Digital Handshake. It's the first thing people experience before they meet you.

### Footer Note
// First impressions still matter.

## SECTION: Who We Built This For

### Section Title
Who We Built This For

### Card 1: The Tradies
**Category:** Electricians / Plumbers / Builders

**The Pain:**
You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. The last thing you want is to spend hours figuring out Wix.

**The Fix:**
A site that shows up on Google search and voice assistants. Get found locally. Get the phone ringing. No homework required.

**Link:** Learn More for Tradies →

### Card 2: The Creatives
**Category:** Salons / Tattoo / Artists

**The Pain:**
You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings and people to find your prices.

**The Fix:**
A beautiful portfolio site that you actually own. Instagram can go down tomorrow — you're still standing.

### Card 3: The Professionals
**Category:** Consultants / Legal / Coaches

**The Pain:**
You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.

**The Fix:**
A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.

## SECTION: How It Works

### Section Headline
Live in 5 Days.
No Homework.
No Jargon.

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview (15 Minutes)
You hate writing "About Us" pages. That's why we don't make you. You call our Voice Agent while driving home. You just talk. We capture everything.

Do it while driving home, having a coffee, or after putting the kids to bed. We designed this because we know you have zero brainpower left after a full day.

**Badge:** NO TYPING REQUIRED

### Step 02: The Factory Build
We build it in 5 days using modern, lightning-fast tech used by top startups. It loads instantly, ranks high, and is impossible to hack. Plus, we set up your Google Maps listing so people actually find you when they search.

**Badges:**
- UNDER 1 SECOND LOAD
- MOBILE FIRST
- SEO & AEO READY
- GOOGLE MAPS READY

### Step 03: The Caretakers
We hand you the keys, but we stay on as caretakers. Hosting, security, updates — sorted. Plus a full design refresh every year.

## SECTION: Testimonials

### Section Title
Real People. Real Results.

### Testimonial 1
"Building a website was my barrier to market—I didn't have the skills. You helped me fulfill a dream. You made this come true."

**— Nicolette, Ember & Ice**
WELLNESS STUDIO

### Testimonial 2
"I'm definitely not up to speed on tech stuff. While I was still figuring out Google Drive, Lian had already built the whole thing from our Facebook. My mates reckon it's banging!"

## SECTION: The Last Website You'll Ever Buy

### Headline
The Last Website
You'll Ever Buy.

### Body Copy
Most websites rot.

They look great on Day 1, but three years later, they look tired.
Then you have to pay another $5,000 to rebuild it.

### Callout Box (Dark Background)
**Not with YourHQ.**

We include a full design refresh every 12 months.
New fonts, new layout, new vibe.

### Comparison: The Old Way
You pay the setup fee once.
Three years later, you pay it again.
And again. And again.

### Comparison: The YourHQ Way
You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.
**Total Rebuild Fees: $0**

---

## SECTION: The Caretaker Model

### Headline
The Caretaker Model (Not an Agency)

### Most Agencies (Red Box)
Most agencies:
- Build your site
- Send an invoice
- Disappear

**We do it differently. We're Caretakers.**

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
✓ We build it (5 days)
✓ We host it (forever)
✓ We fix it (when it breaks)
✓ We refresh it (once a year, free)

### Closing Line
You focus on your business. We keep the digital HQ running.

## SECTION: The Platform Problem

### Headline
The Platform Problem

### Body Copy
You have 8,000 Instagram followers. But here's the truth: you can't export them.

They're not YOUR followers—they're Instagram's users who happen to follow you.

- If your account gets hacked tomorrow, you lose everything.
- If the algorithm changes, your reach disappears.
- If the platform goes down, your business goes dark.

### Callout Box
**You're Zuckerberg's tenant.**
It's time to become an owner.

## SECTION: FAQ (Homepage)

### FAQ 1: How much does a small business website cost in NZ?
For most NZ tradies, salons and consultants, a professional 5-page site typically costs between $700 and $2,000 upfront, plus ongoing hosting and support. YourHQ's Launch package is $995 + GST setup plus $149 + GST per month, which includes unlimited updates and an annual design refresh.

### FAQ 2: How quickly can my tradie website go live?
Most tradie websites go live within 5 business days. After a quick 15-minute phone interview, we build your site while you're on the tools. No meetings, no homework, no tech stress.

### FAQ 3: Do you build websites for salons outside Auckland?
Yes! We're based in Northland but service businesses across all of New Zealand. All communication happens via text and phone, so location doesn't matter.

### FAQ 4: What makes YourHQ different from Wix or Squarespace?
With Wix or Squarespace, you do all the work yourself—40+ hours of building, learning, and troubleshooting. With YourHQ, we do everything for you in 5 days using faster, more secure technology. Plus, you get unlimited updates and annual refreshes included, not extra charges.

### FAQ 5: Will my website help me rank on Google and voice search?
Yes. Every YourHQ site is built with SEO & AEO fundamentals: fast load times (under 1 second), mobile-first design, clean code, and local business schema markup. We optimize for local searches like "electrician near me" or "hair salon [your city]" so customers can actually find you.

**What's SEO & AEO?** SEO (Search Engine Optimization) = showing up in Google search results when people type. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) = showing up when people ask Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa questions like "plumber near me." Both help more customers find you.

### FAQ 6: Do you set up Google Maps for me?
Yes. Every Launch and Growth package includes Google Maps setup. We claim your listing, write your description, upload photos, and connect it to your website. For Growth clients, we also help you start collecting reviews. This is how 86% of customers find local tradies — so you start getting calls from Google, not just from word of mouth.

## SECTION: Real Talk FAQ

### Section Title
Real Talk
The questions you're actually thinking

### Real Talk 1: "My nephew can build me a website for free"
Absolutely give that a go! Just a heads up—will he be around when the site breaks at 11pm on a Friday? Will he refresh the design when it looks dated in 3 years? That's the difference with us—we're here for the long haul. If it doesn't work out with your nephew, give us a call.

### Real Talk 2: "I've been burned by web designers before"
We hear that a lot. That's exactly why we built the 'Love Your Launch' guarantee. We build your site, show you the preview on Day 5, and if you don't love it, we refund you. We've never had to do it, but the option is there.

### Real Talk 3: "I don't have time for this right now"
That's exactly why we designed it this way. Total time from you: one 15-minute phone call while driving home. That's it. We grab everything else from your Facebook and Instagram. You keep running your business while we build in the background.

### Real Talk 4: "It seems too cheap. What's the catch?"
The 'catch' is we use a productised model—we build the same type of site, with the same process, every time. Traditional agencies charge $10-15k because they're doing bespoke work from scratch. We've streamlined everything. Think of it like Uber vs. a private chauffeur—same outcome, smarter process.

## SECTION: What Your Monthly Fee Actually Covers

### Headline
What Your Monthly Fee Actually Covers

It's not just hosting. It's your next website, already paid for.

### Reason 1: Your Next Website Is Already Paid For
Most businesses pay $5,000 every few years to rebuild their site when it starts looking tired. That's $1,666 per year just to stay current.

With YourHQ, your **Annual Design Refresh** is included in your monthly fee. When your 12-month anniversary rolls around, we update your fonts, layout, and hero section. You get a fresh-looking website every year — no surprise invoice.

**Think of your monthly fee as a website savings account.**
Every month, you're putting away a little so your refresh is already covered when the time comes.

### Reason 2: It's a Claimable Business Expense
Just like your phone bill, your insurance, or your Xero subscription — your accountant can generally claim this back as a regular business expense.

✓ No complicated depreciation schedules
✓ No massive upfront cash hit
✓ Simple monthly expense your accountant will recognise

(Tax situations vary — check with your accountant, but most business owners can claim this.)

### Reason 3: We Keep the Lights On
It also covers all the stuff you'll never think about (until it breaks):

**Infrastructure**
- High-speed Vercel hosting
- Daily backups & restore
- SSL security certificate
- Domain name renewal (.co.nz)

**Human Support**
- Unlimited "Text Us" updates
- Tech fixes when things break
- Real humans in Northland
- No chatbots, no runarounds
- Google Maps monitoring & updates

### Closing Line
Think of it like rates for your digital property. You pay to keep it maintained, secure, and looking fresh.

## SECTION: What You're Actually Comparing

### Headline
What You're Actually Comparing

Here's what the alternatives actually cost:

### DIY (Wix/Shopify/Squarespace)
- $30–50/mo for tool
- 40+ hours of your time (@ $50/hr = $2,000)
- Still looks generic
- You're the support person

**= $2,600–3,000 + your sanity**

### Traditional Agency
- $5,000–15,000 upfront (big cash hit)
- $100–250/hr for changes
- 6–12 week build time
- Abandoned after launch — rebuild in 3 years

**= $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years**

### YourHQ
- $995 + GST setup (live in 5 days)
- $149/mo + GST (includes your next refresh)
- Google Maps setup included
- Claimable as a business expense
- **You own it. We handle it. Forever.**

**Professional build + 2 years support = $4,573 + GST**

That's less than half what most agencies charge just to build it — and your accountant can claim it.

## SECTION: The 3-Year Rot Cycle

### Headline
The "3-Year Rot" Cycle (The Old Way)

Most businesses get stuck in an expensive rebuild loop. Here's how it works:

### The Old Way (Red Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $5,000 for a new site.
**Year 2:** Site starts looking dated.
**Year 3:** Site is broken/old. You're embarrassed to share it.
**Year 4:** Pay $5,000 again for a new site.

**Total Cost Over 6 Years:** $15,000+
Plus stress. Plus downtime.

### The YourHQ Way (Blue Box)
**Year 1:** Pay $995 + GST setup. Site goes live in 5 days.
**Year 2:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 3:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.
**Year 4:** Free Design Refresh. Site looks new.

**Total Rebuild Fees:** $0
Your monthly fee already covers it.

### Closing Statement
**The math is undeniable.**

You pay the setup fee once.
You never pay it again.

---

## SECTION: Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

### Headline
Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based

Most web designers build a site, then ghost you.

### Your Website Is Alive
Your website is alive. It needs:
- **Security updates** (weekly)
- **Performance tweaks** (ongoing)
- **Hosting** (always on)
- **The odd fix** when something breaks
- **A refresh** before it starts looking old

### The Problem with Pay-Per-Fix
If you're paying per fix, you either:

A) Get stuck with a broken site you can't afford to fix
B) Overpay for simple changes

### The Solution
**Subscription fixes this. It's predictable. It's fair.**

And because it's a regular monthly expense, your accountant can generally claim it back — unlike a big upfront agency fee.

Think of it like your phone plan vs. paying per text.

---

## SECTION: The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

### Headline
The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We build your site. You see the preview.
**If you don't love it, we refund you.**

(Minus hard costs: ~3% Stripe fees + domain if purchased. You get back ~93-94% of your payment).

We've never had to refund anyone. But the option exists because we put our money where our mouth is.

## SECTION: Pricing Questions (FAQ)

### Section Title
Pricing Questions

### FAQ 1: What does a website cost in New Zealand?
Professional website costs in NZ range from $700 to $15,000+ depending on complexity and who builds it. YourHQ offers three packages: The Starter ($695 + GST setup + $49/mo + GST) for basic one-page sites, The Launch ($995 + GST + $149/mo + GST) for 5-page professional sites, and The Growth ($1,495 + GST + $249/mo + GST) for full-featured sites with booking systems.

### FAQ 2: What's included in the monthly fee?
The monthly fee covers unlimited text and photo updates, high-speed hosting on Vercel, SSL security, daily backups, domain renewal, tech support when things break, and an annual design refresh (valued at $2,000). Think of it as pre-paying for your next website — when your 12-month anniversary comes around, your refresh is already covered. No surprise invoices.

### FAQ 3: Is the monthly fee tax deductible?
Generally, yes. Because it's a regular monthly subscription (like your phone bill or Xero), your accountant can usually claim it as a business expense. This is simpler than a big upfront agency fee, which often needs to be depreciated over time. Check with your accountant for your specific situation, but most business owners find this structure more tax-friendly.

### FAQ 4: Do you work with clients outside Northland?
Yes! We're based in Northland but work with businesses across all of New Zealand—Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Queenstown, and everywhere in between. All communication happens via text, phone, and email, so location doesn't matter. We've built sites for clients nationwide.

### FAQ 5: Can I cancel anytime?
Yes. All packages are month-to-month with no lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. You own all content and can export your site. The subscription covers hosting, maintenance, and updates—not ownership.

### FAQ 6: Is this cheaper than hiring a traditional agency?
Yes, significantly. Traditional NZ agencies charge $5,000–$15,000 upfront, then $100–$250/hour for updates, often totaling $10,000–$20,000 over two years. YourHQ charges $995 + GST setup + $149/month + GST = $4,573 + GST over two years, including unlimited updates and annual refreshes. That's less than half the cost with better ongoing support — and it's easier to claim as a business expense.

### FAQ 7: What's included in the Google Maps setup?
For Launch clients: We claim and verify your Google Maps listing, write your business description, set your service areas, upload your logo and 3-5 photos, and link it to your new website. For Growth clients: We also optimize your listing with all service categories, set up a simple review request system, and create your first Google Post. Most tradies start ranking in local search within 30-60 days.

## SECTION: The Problem

### Headline
You're Fully Booked.
So Why Does It Feel Like You're Leaving Money on the Table?

### Body Copy
Here's the truth no one tells you:

- **46 people** Googled "electrician [your suburb]" this week
- **43 of them** called your competitor (because HE showed up)
- **You got zero** of those calls

Even missing 1-2 jobs per week adds up fast. That's potentially $5,000-$10,000 walking out the door. Every week.

Not because you're bad at your job. Because you're invisible where it counts.

### Callout Box
**Your Facebook Page Isn't Enough**

84% of customers trust a website MORE than social media.

When someone's choosing between you and another sparky, they Google both names. One of you has a professional site. One of you looks like a bloke working out of his ute.

**Which one are you?**

---

## SECTION: Old Mate Dave Test

### Headline
Would You Hire a Tradie With No Website?

### Body Copy
**Be honest.**

If your mate Dave recommended a plumber, you'd still Google him first. And if you found nothing—or worse, a dodgy Facebook page from 2019—you'd think twice.

Your customers are doing the same thing to you. Right now.

**The good news?**

You don't need to spend 40 hours on Wix. You just need 15 minutes on the phone.

---

## SECTION: The Process

### Section Headline
Built in 5 Days.
Zero Homework.
(Seriously.)

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview (15 mins)
Call us while you're driving home. We ask 10 questions. You talk. We capture everything. No forms. No typing. No "About Us" pages to write.

Do it while stuck in traffic on SH1. That's the whole point.

**Badge:** NO WIXING REQUIRED

### Step 02: We Raid Your Socials (0 mins)
We grab your photos from Facebook, your reviews from Google, and your logo from that invoice you sent last week. You don't lift a finger.

**Badge:** WE DO THE DIGGING

### Step 03: The Factory Build (5 Days)
We build it using the same tech as Silicon Valley startups. Loads in under 1 second. Shows up when people Google you. Impossible to hack. You keep doing jobs. We keep building your site.

**Badges:**
- MOBILE FIRST
- SEO & AEO READY

### Step 04: You Go Live
We send you a link. You check it on your phone. Love it? We flip the switch. Hate it? We refund you. Then we stay on as caretakers—hosting, updates, refreshes. You never think about it again.

---

## SECTION: The Math

### Headline
One Extra Job Per Week = $130,000 Per Year

### Body Copy
**Let's do the maths:**

- Average tradie job: $2,500
- One extra job/week from Google: $2,500 × 52 = **$130,000/yr**
- YourHQ investment: $995 + $149/mo

**Payback period? One job.**

We can't guarantee you'll rank #1 tomorrow—that depends on your location and competition. But every tradie we've built for shows up more clearly and gets more calls than before.

## SECTION: Testimonials

### Section Title

### Main Testimonial
"I'm definitely not up to speed on all this tech stuff. While I was still trying to figure out how to upload images to Google Drive, Lian had already grabbed them from our Facebook and built the whole thing. My mates reckon it's banging!"

"You took away my barrier to market. You helped me fulfill a dream."
**— Nicolette, Ember & Ice**

---

## SECTION: Why We Exist

### Headline
Based in Northland. For Tradies Who Don't Have Time for This Stuff.

We started YourHQ because half of NZ small businesses still don't have a website. Not because they're lazy—because they're busy actually doing their job.

We're not a big agency. We're two people who believe tradies deserve to show up on Google without spending 40 hours on Wix or $15K on an agency that ghosts them.

---

## SECTION: Get Found on Google Maps

### Headline
86% of Kiwis Use Google Maps to Find Tradies.
Are You Even On There?

### Body Copy
Here's what happens when someone needs an electrician:

They don't type your name. They type **"electrician near me."**

Google shows them 3 businesses. If you're not one of them, you don't exist.

**We don't just build your website. We put you on the map. Literally.**

Your Google Maps listing gets set up, optimized, and linked to your website. Photos uploaded. Description written. Ready for reviews.

So when someone in your area searches, you show up.

### Feature Box: What's included with every tradie website:

✓ Claim & verify your Google Maps listing
✓ Write your business description (so you don't have to)
✓ Upload your logo + job photos
✓ Set your service areas across Auckland/Northland/wherever you work
✓ Link everything to your new website
✓ Set you up to collect 5-star reviews

**Why does this matter?** Google Maps is where 86% of people look first when they need a tradie. If you're not there — or your listing is empty and sad — they're calling your competitor. We fix that on Day 1.

---

## SECTION: FAQ (Tradies Page)

### FAQ 1: "I'm already fully booked. Why do I need a website?"
That's exactly why you need one. Right now, you're saying yes to every job because you don't have enough inbound. When it slows down, you'll panic.

**A website lets you choose better work, not just more work.** Charge premium rates. Say no to nightmare customers. Go from $90/hr to $120/hr—because you're not desperate.

### FAQ 2: "I don't have time for this."
Neither does any tradie we've worked with. **Total time from you: one 15-minute phone call while driving home.** That's it. We do everything else. You've already spent more time reading this page.

### FAQ 3: "My nephew can build me one for free."
Give it a go! Just ask yourself: **Will he be around when it breaks at 11pm on a Friday?** Will he refresh it when it looks dated in 3 years? Will he optimise it for Google so customers actually find you? If it doesn't work out, we're here.

### FAQ 4: "Websites are expensive."
Bad websites are expensive. Traditional agencies charge $10-15K and disappear. We charge $995 and stay forever. **The real question: can you afford to keep losing jobs to competitors who show up on Google?** The website pays for itself in one job.

### FAQ 5: Will this help me show up on Google Maps?
Yes. We set up and optimize your Google Maps listing as part of every package. We write your description, upload photos, set your service areas, and link it to your website. **Most tradies start appearing in local search results within 30-60 days.** That's when the calls start coming in.

### FAQ 6: I already have a Google listing but it's a mess. Can you fix it?
Yep. If you've already claimed your listing, we'll optimize it. If someone else claimed it (or it's unclaimed), we'll sort that out too. Either way, by the time your website goes live, your Google Maps listing will be connected, accurate, and ready to bring in leads.

### FAQ 7: How do I get more Google reviews?
We set you up with a simple system. After every job, you send your customer a link (we create it for you). They click, leave a review, done. Growth clients get a more automated setup. **Reviews are the #1 factor in Google Maps rankings** — 5 reviews in your first month can make a massive difference.

## HOW IT WORKS PAGE (how-it-works.astro)

### Page Header
**Badge:** The Process

How We Build Your
Digital HQ in 5 Days.

No forms to fill out. No tech jargon. No homework.
Just one phone call and we handle the rest.

**SEO H2:** Our 5-day website builds for NZ small businesses take you from initial phone call to live website faster than traditional agencies. Perfect for tradies, salons, and consultants who need a professional online presence without the tech stress.

---

## SECTION: The Process (Timeline)

### Step 01: The Drive-Home Interview
**Time Required:** 15 Mins

You hate writing "About Us" pages. So don't. Call our AI Voice Agent while driving home or having a coffee.

**The AI asks:**
- "What do you actually do?"
- "Who are your customers?"
- "What makes you different?"

**Badge:** No writing. No forms.

We know tech makes your brain shut down. That's why we designed it this way—just talk, we handle the rest.

### Step 02: We Raid Your Content
**Time Required:** 0 Mins

We go hunting on your Facebook, Instagram, and Google Reviews to find photos and info.

Most businesses already have 90% of the content they need—it's just scattered across Facebook, Instagram, and Google Reviews. We gather it so you don't have to.

Time required from you: **zero**.

**Badge:** We do this ourselves.

### Step 03: The Factory Build
**Action:** We Build

Days 1-4. We build your site using **Astro + Tailwind CSS** (Silicon Valley tech).

**Features:**
- Under 1 second load time
- Mobile-first design
- SEO Fundamentals

**Plus: Google Maps Setup**
While we're building your website, we also claim and set up your Google Maps listing. We write the description, upload photos, set your service areas, and connect everything. By the time your site goes live, you're ready to be found.

**Badge:** You run your business.

### Step 04: The Preview (Day 5)
**Decision:** Love/Hate

We send you a private link. You view it on your phone.

**If you want changes:** We make them in 24 hours.
**If you hate it:** We refund you (minus ~3% processing fees).

**Badge:** Refund if you hate it.

### Step 05: You Go Live

We flip the switch. Your domain is live. Google is notified.

You get back to work. We become the caretakers.

**CTA:** Start Your Build

## SECTION: After Go Live - The Caretaker Relationship

### Headline
After Go Live: The Caretaker Relationship

Most web designers ghost you after launch. We stick around.

### Examples:
- **Need your phone number changed?** Text us.
- **Want to add a photo from your latest job?** Text us.
- **Something breaks at 11pm?** We fix it.
- **Site looking tired after a year?** We refresh it—free.

### Closing:
**You focus on your business.**
We keep the digital HQ running.

---

## SECTION: The Asset Model

**Badge:** The Asset Model

### Headline
The Last Setup Fee You'll Ever Pay.

Traditional websites are like bananas. They look great on Day 1, but three years later, they're rotten. Then you have to pay another $5,000 to rebuild it.

**Not with YourHQ. We refresh your design every year. For free.**

**CTA:** See Pricing Details →

### Comparison: The "3-Year Rot" Cycle
**Year 1:** -$5,000 (Build)
**Year 2:** Looking dated...
**Year 3:** Code breaks...
**Year 4:** -$5,000 (Rebuild)

### Comparison: The YourHQ Way
**Badge:** Future Proofed

**Year 1:** -$995 (Setup)
**Year 2:** Free Refresh ✨
**Year 3:** Free Refresh ✨
**Year 4:** Free Refresh ✨

## SECTION: The Caretaker Model

### Headline
The Caretaker Model.

You own the house. We mow the lawns.

Most websites die a slow death because nobody updates the plugins or fixes the security. We handle all the boring stuff so you don't have to.

### The "Text Us" Service
Need something updated? Just text us.

**Examples:**
- "Hey, change my phone number to..."
- "Can you add this photo from the job?"
- "Update my price list."

**Turnaround:** 24-48 hours. No meetings.

### What's Included?

**Hosting & Security**
Fast Vercel servers, SSL certificates, daily backups.

**Unlimited Updates**
Text or email us changes anytime.

**Annual Design Refresh** (Featured)
**Badge:** Forever Fresh
Every 12 months, we redesign your site for free so it never looks old.

### Testimonial 2

## OUR STORY PAGE (our-story.astro)

### Page Header
Two Mates.
One Mission.

**Subtitle:** Friends first. Business partners second. Here to help you own your digital space.

---

## SECTION 1: How YourHQ Started

### Headline
How YourHQ Started

Here's a stat that stuck in my head from my entrepreneurship studies: only 50% of small to medium businesses in New Zealand have a website.

**Half. In 2025.**

### Body Copy
And I kept thinking about it. Especially as I watched friends build up these incredible profiles on Instagram and Facebook — years of work, thousands of followers, their whole customer base — and then poof. Banned. Hacked. Algorithm changed. Everything gone.

All that work. All those contacts. Just... vanished.

### Quote Box
"I'm also the kind of person who checks websites before I hire anyone. If I'm picking between two tradies and one's got a beautiful website? I go with that tradie. Every time. It's not rational — but it's real."

### The Mission
So when I started learning to code and building AI systems for my Master's, I kept coming back to this question: **How do I create something that actually gets these business owners online?** Not another DIY tool they'll never finish. A system that does the hard part for them.

### Dad's Story
**And honestly? I think about my dad.**

He ran a small business — *Maungi Tanks*. He's not with us anymore. But I imagine what it would've been like to build him a website. To see his face when he saw himself on the internet for the first time.

He would have loved it. It would have made him proud.

### Mission Statement Box
**That's why YourHQ exists.**

For the tradies. The salon owners. The consultants. The small business people who are brilliant at what they do — but never got around to the website part.

I want to give them what I wish I could've given my dad.

---

## SECTION 2 & 3: Meet The Team

### Section Title
Meet The Team

### Lian - Founder & Lead Developer

I've spent 15 years helping people communicate better — building learning experiences, designing systems, translating complexity into clarity.

When I started building AI agents for my Master's research, I accidentally taught myself to code. Then I had a thought: If I can build web apps... why not build websites?

Turns out, I loved it. The problem-solving. The logic puzzles. Taking someone's story and translating it exactly into digital form.

**What I bring:**
Silicon Valley infrastructure with Pacific warmth. I handle the builds, the tech, the design — and making sure your website actually sounds like you.

---

### Nic - Business Development Manager

I'm Nic — your first point of contact and biggest cheerleader.

**Here's the thing: I didn't just join YourHQ. I used YourHQ.**

When Lian asked if I'd pilot the service, I'd spent that morning wrestling with Wix, drowning in templates and decisions. Then she asked me a few questions, went away, and built me a website that actually looked like my business.

I nearly cried. Building a website was my barrier to market — the thing holding me back from launching my dream. And just like that, the blocker was gone. Now I'm here to help you do the same.

**What I bring:**
I'm not a pushy salesperson. I'm someone who listens, understands where you're coming from, and helps you figure out if this is right for you. Think of me as a friendly guide who happens to believe in this service because it changed my own trajectory.

---

## SECTION 4: Friends First. Always.

### Headline
Friends First. Always.

We've been mates for over 12 years.

We've played rugby together. We've raised kids the same age. We've been each other's hype girls through every wild idea, every hard season, every "what if I just..." conversation.

The kind of friends who don't need to talk every day, but when we get together, it feels like yesterday.

When Lian knew she needed someone to handle the people side of YourHQ — someone who could walk into any room and make everyone feel at ease — Nic was the only person she asked.

**Not because we wanted to work together.**
**Because we trust each other completely.**

### Closing Box
**And that's what you get when you work with us:**

Two people who genuinely care. Who've been in the small business hustle ourselves. Who want to see you thrive — not just sell you something.

---

## SECTION 5: The Best of Both Worlds

### Headline
The Best of Both Worlds

### With Lian
You get someone who obsesses over getting your message right. Who builds infrastructure that works while you sleep. Who won't rest until your website actually sounds like you.

### With Nic
You get someone who makes you feel heard. Who answers your questions without jargon. Who you'll walk away from thinking, "I think I just made a new friend."

### Closing
**We're not a faceless agency.**

We're two Kiwis who believe you deserve to own your digital space.

And we're pretty good at making that happen.

The Fine Print

### FAQ 1: Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?
Nope. Refer 12 people, and you don't pay us a cent for a whole year.

### FAQ 2: When do I get my free month?
As soon as your friend pays their setup fee, we credit your account for the next billing cycle.

### FAQ 3: Can I refer myself for a second business?
Nice try! But actually... yes. If you own a second business, we'll treat it as a referral.

## YOURHQ NETWORK PAGE (network.astro)

When a client asks, *"Do you know anyone who does websites?"* — now you do.

**CTA Buttons:**

- How It Works

## SECTION 1: The Problem (From your side of the desk)

### Headline
The Problem
(From your side of the desk)

You see this all the time. The tradie doing great work but losing jobs to competitors. The salon owner whose whole business lives on Instagram.

**They ask you for advice. You tell them they need a website. Then comes the awkward part.**

### Problem Cards:

**Option A: Wix / DIY**
Means 40 hours of your client's time, frustration, and usually no result.

**Option B: Agencies**
Means big money ($5k+) and long delays. Often overkill for what they need.

**Option C: Doing Nothing**
Means having the exact same conversation next quarter. Your client stays stuck.

### Solution Pop:
**That's the gap the YourHQ Network fills.**

---

## SECTION 2: What We Do

### Headline
Websites for Small Biz.
Fast. Zero Homework.

**No Homework**
We don't ask clients to write copy. We interview them, pull what we need, and build it.

**Small Biz Pricing**
Setup from **$695**. Ongoing care from **$49/mo**. Not agency pricing. Not DIY pain.

**The Caretaker Model**
We don't build and disappear. We host, maintain, and update the site so it stays current.

If they don't like the preview, we refund them. Your reputation stays intact.

**Practical Tools**
We provide co-branded resources you can actually use — guides and checklists with your logo on them. Helpful, not salesy.

**Credible Network**
Network members are listed on our internal directory and featured when relevant. No black holes. No random hand-offs.

No. We focus on long-term value exchange, not transactional kickbacks. We reciprocate by sending our clients to you when they need your specific services.

### FAQ 2: What if my client has a bad experience?
We fix it — or refund them. Protecting your trust is non-negotiable. We offer a 'Love Your Launch' guarantee where if they don't like the preview, they get their money back.

### FAQ 3: How do I make a referral?
It's simple. Text or email Nic with their name and number (after getting their permission). We take it from there.

### FAQ 4: Do I need to commit to anything?

## LEGAL / TERMS & FAQ PAGE (legal.astro)

### Page Title
Terms & FAQ

Transparent terms. No lock-ins. You own everything.

---

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### FAQ 1: Do I own my website?
Yes. You own the domain name, the content, and the design. If you cancel, we transfer the domain and provide a ZIP file of your site code.

### FAQ 2: What happens if I cancel?
No lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime. We will transfer your domain to your own account and give you your files. However, you will lose the hosting, security updates, and "text us" support.

### FAQ 3: Can I update the site myself?
**Launch & Growth Plans:** No need! Unlimited text/photo updates are included in your monthly fee. Just text us.

**Starter Plan:** Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.

---

## TERMS OF TRADE (Plain English)

### 1. Payments
**Setup fees are paid 100% upfront** to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.

### 2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)
We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee **before the site goes live**.

*Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).*

### 3. Liability
We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).
