### 2. ✅ Softened Agency Cost Claims

**Changed FROM (definitive claims):**
- "Traditional agencies charge $10-15K"
- "Traditional NZ agencies charge $5,000–$15,000"
- "$10,000–20,000+ over 2 years"

**Changed TO (softer language):**
- "Some agencies charge $10-15K"
- "Some NZ agencies charge $5,000–$15,000"
- "up to $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years"

**— Reuben, Johnson & Sons**
COMMERCIAL BUILDER

**Testimonial 2:**
"The AI agent was a breeze—stress-free, quick, and foolproof. Busy people need to know how easy this is."
