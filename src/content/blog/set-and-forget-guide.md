"Set and Forget" is a myth in technology. Software needs updates. Servers need patching. Domains expire.

If you DIY your site, "forgetting" about it means waking up one day to find it hacked or offline.

## The Caretaker Model

We designed YourHQ to be the closest thing to "Set and Forget" that actually exists.

You pay a monthly fee. We become the IT department.
*   **SSL Certificates:** We renew them.
*   **Hosting:** We manage the servers.
*   **Content:** You text us a photo, we upload it.

You don't need to know what a DNS record is. You just need to run your business. We handle the infrastructure.
