I look at business through the lens of systems. If a system requires your manual input for every low-value task, it’s a broken system.

Answering the phone 10 times a day to say "No, we don't do appliance repairs" or "Our minimum charge is $X" is a broken system.

## Your Website is an Employee

Think of your website as a digital admin assistant that works 24/7/365. Its job is to:

1.  **Answer FAQs:** List your services clearly. If you don't do fences, say it.
2.  **Set Expectations:** State your service areas and rough timelines.
3.  **Qualify Leads:** Use a contact form that asks "What is your budget?" or "When do you need this done?"

## The Result: Better Data

When you finally pick up the phone or reply to an email, you’re talking to a qualified lead who knows what you do and can afford you.

You get off the phone and back on the tools. That’s efficiency.
