In the tech world, we talk about "User Experience" (UX). It’s how a person *feels* when interacting with a system.

If a client walks into your salon, the UX is likely amazing. Good lighting, expensive products, great coffee. You charge accordingly.

But what is the UX *before* they walk in?

## The Disconnect

If a client clicks a link in your bio and lands on a messy, generic Linktree or a broken mobile page, the UX is cheap.

There is a cognitive dissonance: *"They want $350 for a colour, but they won't spend $50 on a proper website?"*

## High Tech, High Touch

A custom website acts as a digital foyer. It should feel as curated and premium as your physical space. It justifies your pricing before the client even sits in the chair.

Don't let your digital infrastructure undervalue your artistic skill.
