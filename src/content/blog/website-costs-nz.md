If you've asked around for website quotes recently, you're probably confused as hell.

One freelancer said $500. A local agency said $12,000. Your mate's nephew said he'd do it for a box of beers and a case of Tui.

Why is the gap so massive? And what's a fair price for a small business in Aotearoa?

Here's the truth: **Web design prices in NZ can range from $500 to $75,000+** [web:238]. That's not a typo. The same "thing" (a website) can cost 150 times more depending on who you ask.

But here's what nobody tells you: They're not actually selling the same thing.

Let me break it down.

## The Three Tiers of Web Design (And Why Traditional Pricing Is Broken)

### Tier 1: The "Fiverr" Special ($500 - $1,500)

This is usually someone offshore, a student, or your mate's nephew who "knows a bit about websites."

**What you get:**
- Pre-made template with your logo slapped on it
- Basic pages (Home, About, Contact)
- Hosted on cheap shared hosting
- Minimal customisation
- Zero ongoing support

#### Pros:
- Cheap upfront cost
- Fast turnaround (usually)

#### Cons:
- Often broken English or poor copy
- Generic templates that look like everyone else's site
- Zero support after handover (good luck when something breaks)
- Poor SEO (won't rank on Google)
- No mobile optimisation (or poorly done)
- Security vulnerabilities (39.1% of hacked websites were running outdated software [web:240])

**Who this works for:** Testing a business idea with literally no budget.

**Who this doesn't work for:** Anyone who needs their website to actually generate leads or revenue.

### Tier 2: The Traditional Agency ($8,000 - $30,000+)

This is the "old way" of building websites. Big teams. Long timelines. Expensive hourly rates.

**What you get:**
- Custom design (eventually)
- Strategy sessions and brand workshops
- Project manager and dedicated team
- 6-12 week timeline (sometimes longer)

**NZ market reality:** Most agencies charge $8,000-$30,000 for small business sites, with annual maintenance costing $2,000-$10,000 [web:238].

#### Pros:
- Professional result (if you can afford to wait)
- Dedicated team

#### Cons:
- **Expensive** (because their process is inefficient)
- **Slow** (6-12 weeks because they're still coding everything manually)
- **Overkill** for most small businesses
- Still requires separate maintenance costs

**The real issue?** Traditional agencies are stuck in 2015. They're billing $150+/hour for work that modern tools can do in a fraction of the time.

**Who this works for:** Large corporate clients with big budgets and no urgency.

**Who this doesn't work for:** Small businesses that need results fast without spending their entire marketing budget on a website.

### Tier 3: The Modern Disruptor ($695 - $1,495 setup + monthly)

This is where YourHQ sits. **Same quality. Faster delivery. Lower price.**

How? By using modern tools that traditional agencies refuse to adopt.

#### The Efficiency Stack:

**AI-Assisted Content Creation**  
We use AI to help write copy, structure content, and speed up the build process. What used to take agencies 40 hours of manual copywriting now takes us 8-12 hours—without sacrificing quality.

(Traditional agencies will tell you "AI can't write good copy." They're wrong. AI can't *replace* human judgement, but it can massively accelerate the process when used properly.)

**Modern Frameworks (Astro)**  
We build on static site generators that are faster, more secure, and easier to maintain than WordPress or traditional CMS platforms [web:60].

Sites load in under 2 seconds. No bloated plugins. No security nightmares. No monthly WordPress maintenance hell.

**Streamlined Process**  
No 6-week timelines. No endless revision cycles. We do a voice interview with you on your drive home from work, build your site in 5-7 days, and launch.

Traditional agencies need multiple meetings, brand workshops, and approval stages because their process is broken. We've cut the fat.

## What You Actually Get at YourHQ

### The Starter ($695 + $49/month)

Perfect for "I just need something online."

- One-page professional scroll site
- Gets you found on Google
- Domain & hosting included
- No content updates (pay-as-you-go for changes)

**Who this works for:** Absolute minimum online presence. You're testing an idea or need a digital business card.

### The Launch ($995 + $149/month)

This is our bread and butter for tradies, retailers, and service businesses.

- 5-page professional website
- Voice interview (we write your content based on what you tell us)
- Domain & high-speed hosting
- **Unlimited text/photo updates** (text us, we do it)
- **Annual design refresh** (so you never look outdated)
- SEO-optimised and mobile-responsive

**Who this works for:** Electricians, plumbers, builders, accountants, physios—anyone who needs a professional site that generates leads.

### The Growth ($1,495 + $199/month)

For salons, consultants, and businesses that need booking systems.

- Everything in Launch, plus:
- **Booking system integration** (Fresha, Timely, Calendly)
- Blog/news section for SEO
- Instagram feed integration
- Priority 24-hour support

**Who this works for:** Salons, consultants, coaches, wellness businesses—anyone who books appointments or needs ongoing content.

## Why Monthly Instead of a Big Lump Sum?

Here's what most people don't realise when they pay $8,000 upfront for a website:

**That's just the beginning.**

Websites aren't "set and forget." They need:
- Security updates
- Hosting and domain renewal
- Content updates (prices, services, photos)
- Technical troubleshooting when things break
- SEO maintenance
- Performance optimisation

**Annual website maintenance in NZ costs $400-$10,000 depending on complexity** [web:238].

But here's the problem: **Most small business owners don't budget for this.** They pay the upfront cost, launch the site, and then... nothing. The site sits there, slowly decaying.

### The Real Cost of Neglect

**Security breaches:** 39.1% of hacked websites were running outdated software [web:240]. The average cost of a data breach in 2024 is $4.88 million [web:245].

**Downtime:** Website downtime costs businesses an average of $5,600 per minute [web:245][web:247].

**Lost rankings:** Neglected websites drop in Google rankings. Companies lacking systematic website maintenance see marketing effectiveness drop by up to 20% [web:245].

**Reputation damage:** 75% of consumers judge your credibility based on your website [web:110]. If your site looks outdated or broken? They're booking with your competitor.

### What the Monthly Fee Actually Covers

Think of it like Body Corporate rates for your digital property:

**Infrastructure:**
- High-speed Vercel hosting (not cheap shared hosting)
- Daily backups & restore capability
- SSL security certificate
- Domain name renewal

**Human Support:**
- Unlimited text/photo updates (Launch & Growth packages)
- Tech fixes when things break
- **Annual design refresh** (worth $2,000+ on its own)
- Real humans, based in Whangārei

## The Cost Comparison Over 3 Years

Let's do the actual maths:

### Traditional Agency Model:
- **Upfront:** $8,000
- **Year 1 maintenance:** $1,200
- **Year 2 maintenance:** $1,200
- **Year 3 maintenance:** $1,200
- **Emergency fixes:** $800 (conservative)
- **Redesign in Year 3 because it looks dated:** $5,000

**Total 3-year cost:** $17,400

### YourHQ Launch Model:
- **Setup:** $995
- **Monthly fee:** $149/month × 36 months = $5,364
- **Annual refresh included:** $0
- **Emergency fixes:** $0
- **Updates:** $0

**Total 3-year cost:** $6,359

**You save $11,041 over 3 years.** Plus you get ongoing support, annual refreshes, and peace of mind.

## Why Traditional Agencies Charge So Much

It's not greed. It's inefficiency.

Traditional agencies have:
- Large teams with overhead
- Manual processes that take 6-12 weeks
- Project managers billing hours for every email
- Expensive offices in Auckland or Wellington
- Outdated technology stacks that require constant maintenance

We've stripped all that out:
- Small team, remote-based (Whangārei)
- AI-assisted workflows (5-7 day builds)
- Modern tech stack (Astro) that's inherently faster
- No fancy office rent to pass on to you

**We're not cutting corners. We're just more efficient.**

## The ROI Question: What Should a Website Generate?

**A small improvement in conversion rate from 2% to 3% equals a 50% increase in ROI** [web:249].

### Example: Local Tradie

- **Monthly website visitors:** 300
- **Current conversion rate:** 2% (6 enquiries)
- **Average job value:** $2,500
- **Monthly revenue from website:** $15,000

Now with a proper website:
- Better design, faster load times, clear calls-to-action
- **New conversion rate:** 3% (9 enquiries)
- **New monthly revenue:** $22,500
- **Additional monthly revenue:** $7,500
- **Additional annual revenue:** $90,000

**Your website costs you $149/month ($1,788/year).** It generates an extra $90,000/year.

**That's a 5,000% ROI.**

Even if we're conservative and say your website only generates one extra job per month at $2,500, that's $30,000/year in additional revenue.

Still a 1,577% ROI.

## Red Flags to Watch Out For

**"We'll build you a website for $300."**  
Run. You're getting a template with zero customisation and no support.

**"We don't list our prices—every project is different."**  
Translation: "We charge whatever we think you can afford." Transparent pricing should be standard.

**"Pay the full amount upfront before we start."**  
Standard practice is deposit + payment on completion. Full payment upfront is a red flag.

**"We'll get you on page 1 of Google within a week."**  
SEO doesn't work that way. Anyone promising instant rankings is lying.

**"Hosting and maintenance are extra—we'll invoice when needed."**  
Get a clear maintenance agreement upfront. Surprise invoices are the worst.

## What You Should Actually Pay (Our Honest Recommendation)

### If You Just Need Something Online Fast:
**Budget:** $695 setup + $49/month  
**Get:** [The Starter](/pricing)  
**Best for:** Testing ideas, bare minimum presence

**Get:** [The Launch](/pricing)  
**Best for:** Tradies, consultants, retailers, service businesses

**Solution:** Traditional agency

## The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee

We build your site. You see the preview before it goes live.

**If you don't love it, we refund you.**

(Minus hard costs: ~3% Stripe fees + domain if purchased. You get back ~93-94% of your payment.)

We've never had to refund anyone. But the option exists because we put our money where our mouth is.

## The Bottom Line

Your website isn't a brochure. It's infrastructure.

It's your 24/7 salesperson. Your portfolio. Your booking system. Your credibility builder.

Traditional agencies will charge you $8,000-$30,000 and take 12 weeks because their process is stuck in 2015.

We charge $995-$1,495 and deliver in 7 days because we've embraced modern tools that make us faster without sacrificing quality.

**A well-maintained website can generate 100% ROI within 12 months** [web:249]. But only if it's professional, fast, secure, and kept up-to-date.

That's why we include maintenance, updates, and annual refreshes in the monthly fee. Because a $995 website that gets abandoned and hacked 2 years later isn't an asset. It's a liability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is your pricing so much lower than traditional agencies?**

We're not cheaper because we cut corners—we're more efficient. Traditional agencies charge $8,000-$30,000 because they have large teams, manual processes, and 6-12 week timelines. We use AI-assisted workflows and modern frameworks (Astro) that let us deliver the same quality in 5-7 days with a smaller team. We're remote-based in Whangārei, not paying Auckland office rent. This efficiency lets us pass savings to you.

**What happens if I cancel my monthly subscription?**

You own your domain—we transfer it to you. Your content is yours. You can take it and host elsewhere (though you'll need to find someone to maintain it). Most clients don't cancel because $149-$199/month for a maintained, secure, professional website that generates leads is one of the best ROI investments you can make. But there's no lock-in contract.

**How is this different from Wix or Squarespace?**

DIY platforms like Wix cost $20-$50/month but require you to build and maintain everything yourself. You're responsible for design, SEO, content, troubleshooting. Our sites are built on Astro—faster, cleaner code that loads in under 2 seconds vs 4-6 seconds for Wix. Plus you get professional copywriting, design, SEO setup, and ongoing support. You're buying expertise and time, not just software.

**Can you really build a professional website in 5-7 days?**

Yes. We do a voice interview with you (30-45 minutes), use AI to help structure content efficiently, and build on Astro which is inherently faster than traditional CMS platforms. Traditional agencies take 6-12 weeks because they have inefficient approval processes, manual coding, and large teams. We've streamlined the entire workflow. You get the same quality in a fraction of the time.

**What's included in the annual design refresh?**

Every 12 months, we update your site's design to keep it looking current—new layouts, updated colour schemes, modern typography, refreshed imagery. This alone is worth $2,000+ if you paid an agency separately. It's included in your monthly fee because we never want your site to look outdated. Your competitor got a new website last year? We'll make sure yours still looks just as good.
