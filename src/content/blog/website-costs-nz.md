If you’ve asked around for website quotes recently, you’re probably confused.

One freelancer said $500. A local agency said $12,000. Your nephew said he’d do it for a box of beers.

Why is the gap so big? And what is a fair price for a small business in Aotearoa?

## The Three Tiers of Web Design

### 1. The "Fiverr" Special ($500 - $1,500)
Usually offshore or a student.
*   **Pros:** Cheap.
*   **Cons:** Often broken English, zero support, disappears when the site breaks, generic templates. You get what you pay for.

### 2. The Boutique Agency ($5,000 - $15,000)
Custom design, strategy sessions, branding workshops.
*   **Pros:** Stunning, award-winning design.
*   **Cons:** Expensive. Slow (6-12 weeks). Overkill for a local plumber or accountant.

### 3. The "Website as a Service" Model (Us)
This is a newer model gaining traction globally. Instead of a massive lump sum, you pay a setup fee and a monthly membership.

## Why We Charge Monthly

At YourHQ, we charge **$995 upfront** and **$149/month**.

Think of the monthly fee like Body Corporate rates for your digital property. It covers:
*   **Hosting:** High-speed servers (not cheap shared hosting).
*   **Security:** SSL certificates and firewalls.
*   **The Caretaker:** When you need to change a photo or update a price, you text us. We do it.
*   **The Annual Refresh:** Every 12 months, we freshen up the design so you never look outdated.

It keeps your cash flow healthy and ensures you never have an "abandoned" website that gets hacked 3 years later.
