In the tech industry, we call it "Technical Debt." It's the cost of not maintaining your systems.

If your website was built in 2012 (or even 2018), the underlying technology has shifted dramatically. Here are the 5 signs your site has expired:

1.  **Not Mobile Responsive:** Do users have to "pinch and zoom" to read text on an iPhone? That's a dealbreaker today.
2.  **Not Secure:** Does the browser say "Not Secure" in the URL bar? This destroys trust.
3.  **Slow Load Times:** Modern internet users wait less than 3 seconds. Old code is often bloated and slow.
4.  **Flash Player:** If you have elements that don't load on Apple devices, they need to go.
5.  **Broken Forms:** Are your enquiries actually landing in your inbox?

## The Fix: Rebuild, Don't Patch

Sometimes it's cleaner to rebuild the house than fix the rot. We use modern, static frameworks (Astro) that are secure by default and lightning fast.
