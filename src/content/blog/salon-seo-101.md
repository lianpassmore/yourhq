Instagram relies on **Discovery** (scrolling and finding). Google relies on **Intent** (searching for a specific solution).

When someone searches "Best Balayage Whangārei," they have high intent. They are ready to book. But a generic homepage often won't rank for that specific term.

## The Strategy: Specific Pages

As part of our Growth package, we structure sites with specific pages for specific services.

Instead of just one list of services, we build a page called "Blonde & Balayage." We tag the images correctly. We use the right headers.

This signals to Google: *"This isn't just a salon; this is THE specialist for this specific service."*

That is how you win on search. Structure, not luck.
