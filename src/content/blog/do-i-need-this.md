Your mate Dave reckons you need a website.

You've heard it from your accountant. Maybe your wife. That young sparkie down the road who's always banging on about "online presence."

And every time someone says it, you think the same thing:

*"But I'm already busy. I get all my work from word of mouth and Facebook. Why would I spend money on something I don't need?"*

Fair question. Let's actually answer it—with maths, not marketing fluff.

Because here's the thing: You might not need a website to survive. But you're almost certainly losing money without one. And once you see the numbers, you'll understand why Dave keeps going on about it.

## The Honest Answer (No BS)

If you're getting all the work you want, at the rates you want, from the clients you want—you don't need a website.

There. I said it.

If you're fully booked with premium jobs, charging $120+ an hour, working with clients who respect your time and pay on time, and you're genuinely happy with your work-life balance? Keep doing what you're doing. Seriously.

But here's where most tradies kid themselves. **They say "I'm busy" when what they really mean is "I'm surviving."**

They're saying yes to every job because they can't afford to say no. They're charging $85/hour when the guy down the road charges $130. They're working 60-hour weeks and still stressed about where next month's work is coming from.

That's not busy. That's stuck.

## What You're Actually Losing (The Maths)

Let's talk numbers. Not feelings. Numbers.

*   **46%** of all Google searches have local intent.
*   **97%** of people search online to find local businesses.
*   **78%** of local mobile searches result in a purchase within 24 hours.

When someone Googles "electrician near me," they're not browsing. They're buying. Today.

Now let's make this specific to you.

Say you're a sparkie in Auckland. Let's be conservative and say 100 people per week Google "electrician Auckland" or "electrician near me" in your area.

1.  46 of those searches have local intent (46%)
2.  97% of those people are actively looking for someone to hire
3.  78% will book someone **TODAY**

That's roughly **35 people per week** who are ready to pay an electrician right now.

Where are those 35 people going? To the tradies who show up on Google. The ones with websites. If you don't have a website, you're invisible to those 35 people. Every single week.

## The "But I Get All My Work From Word of Mouth" Problem

I hear this constantly. And it's true—word of mouth is powerful. Referrals are gold.

But here's what happens when someone gets referred to you:

1.  Their mate says, "Use Davo's Electrical. He's good."
2.  They Google "Davo's Electrical."
3.  They find... nothing. Or a Facebook page with 3 posts from 2019.
4.  They think, *"Hmm, is this guy even still in business? Is he legit?"*
5.  They Google "electrician [suburb]" instead—just to see what else is out there.
6.  They find a sparkie with a professional website, 50 Google reviews, clear pricing, and a "Book Now" button.
7.  **They book the other guy.**

You just lost a referred job. And you'll never even know it happened.

**81% of consumers research a business online before making a purchase decision.** That means 4 out of 5 people who get referred to you will Google you before they call.

## The Money You're Leaving on the Table

Let's do the maths on what "invisible on Google" actually costs.

**Assumptions:**
*   100 people per week search for your trade in your area
*   35 of them are ready to book today
*   Average job value: $2,500

Without a website, you're capturing **0** of those Google leads.

If you had a website ranking in the top 5:
*   You'd capture roughly 5-10% of those searches.
*   That's 3-4 new enquiries per week from Google alone.
*   Let's say you convert half of those.
*   That's **1-2 extra jobs per week**.

**1 extra job per week × $2,500 × 52 weeks = $130,000 per year.**

That's not fantasy. That's the maths on what Google traffic is worth to a tradie who actually shows up. And right now? You're getting $0 of it.

## The Honest Summary

Do you **NEED** a website to survive as a tradie in 2026?
No. You can probably keep getting by on word of mouth and Facebook.

Are you leaving serious money on the table without one?
Yes. Conservatively, $50,000-$100,000+ per year in lost leads, lost referrals, and pricing power you don't have.

Is it worth the investment?
A proper website costs $1,000-$2,000. Pays for itself in 1-2 jobs. Returns 10-100x over the next few years.

You do the maths.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I really need a website if I get all my work from word of mouth?**
Word of mouth gets your name in front of people, but 81% of consumers research businesses online before making a purchase decision. When someone gets referred to you and Googles your name, finding nothing—or just an outdated Facebook page—costs you jobs you'll never know you lost. A website ensures that every referral converts instead of bouncing to a competitor.

**How much does not having a website actually cost a tradie?**
Conservative estimates suggest tradies without websites miss out on $130,000-$260,000 per year in Google-sourced leads alone. On top of that, you lose $25,000-$50,000 in referred leads who Google you, can't find anything credible, and book a competitor instead. The total opportunity cost far exceeds the $1,000-$3,000 a website costs per year.

**Can't I just use my Facebook page instead of a website?**
Facebook can't rank on Google, where 97% of people search for local businesses. It requires constant posting to stay visible, and it's "rented land"—Facebook controls what your audience sees. Most importantly, 84% of consumers find dedicated websites more credible than social media pages. A Facebook page supports your business; it can't replace a website.

**How quickly would a tradie website pay for itself?**
Most tradies see payback within 1-2 jobs—typically within the first 1-3 weeks of launch. A $1,500 website that generates just one extra $2,500 job has already paid for itself. Over 12 months, the return is typically 30-50x the initial investment.
