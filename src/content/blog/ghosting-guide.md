You drive 30 minutes to a job. You measure up. You drive home. You spend 20 minutes writing the quote. You send it.

And then... nothing.

No "thanks," no "too expensive," just silence. Two weeks later you drive past and see another van in the driveway.

Ghosting is frustrating. But it's not random. It happens for specific reasons, and most are fixable.

## Why Customers Ghost (The Real Reasons)

**Reason 1: They were never serious.**
They are collecting quotes for insurance, or "just curious."

**Reason 2: They got a cheaper quote and feel awkward.**
This is the big one. They liked you, but someone was $500 cheaper. They feel guilty telling you, so they say nothing.

**Reason 3: They don't trust your price equals your value.**
You quoted $3,500. Someone else quoted $2,800. They can't tell the difference, so they assume you're ripping them off.

## The Trust Gap

When a customer ghosts, it's usually a **Trust Problem**.

They can't evaluate your skills (they're not tradies). All they have to go on is:
1.  The price.
2.  Their gut feeling.
3.  **What they find when they Google you.**

**81% of consumers research a business online before buying.**

If they Google you and find nothing (or a bad Facebook page), and then Google the other guy and find a pro website with 50 reviews... you lose. Even if your quote was better.

## The Fix: Pre-Qualification

Stop quoting tyre-kickers. Before you get in the van, ask:
*   *"When are you looking to get this done?"*
*   *"Have you got a rough budget in mind?"*

A website helps here. A quote request form that asks these questions upfront filters out 40% of unqualified leads before they waste your time.

## The Fix: The Credibility Build

If you look professional *before* you arrive, you win half the battle.

*   Professional website with portfolio photos.
*   Clear service descriptions.
*   Qualifications and insurance displayed.

When they call you for a quote AFTER seeing this, they aren't a cold lead. They already trust you. These leads convert at **50-60%**, compared to 20-25% for cold leads.

## The Fix: The Follow-Up Sequence

48% of salespeople never follow up. Be the one who does.

**Day 2-3:** "Hey, just checking you got the quote okay? Happy to answer questions." (Service check, not sales push).
**Day 7:** "Hi, checking if you've had a chance to think about the job. I've got availability next week..."
**Day 14:** "I'll assume this isn't going ahead for now. Quote is valid for 30 days." (Close the loop).

## The Bottom Line

Ghosting happens because:
1.  They weren't serious (Pre-qualify them).
2.  They didn't trust your value (Build online credibility).
3.  They felt awkward (Follow up professionally).

A professional website handles the first two automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's a normal quote conversion rate for tradies?**
The average quote-to-job conversion rate for trade businesses sits around 25-35%. However, tradies with professional websites and strong Google reviews consistently convert at 50-60%, because customers have already built trust before the quote arrives. The difference isn't your pricing—it's your perceived credibility.

**Why do customers ghost instead of just saying no?**
It's human nature to avoid awkward conversations, especially about money. When a customer chooses a cheaper competitor, they feel guilty telling you—so they say nothing. A structured follow-up sequence gives them a low-pressure way to respond and keeps you in control of the conversation.

**How does having a website help me win more quotes?**
A website builds trust before you even arrive on site. 75% of consumers judge a business's credibility based on web design alone. When a customer receives your quote and then Googles you, finding a professional site with reviews, portfolio photos, and clear service descriptions makes them far more likely to accept your price—even if it's higher than competitors.

**What should I include on my website to improve quote conversions?**
Focus on trust signals: portfolio photos of completed work, Google reviews prominently displayed, qualifications and insurance details, clear service descriptions, and a professional contact form that pre-qualifies leads. These elements do the selling before you arrive, so you're quoting warm leads instead of cold ones.
