I love LinkedIn. It's a great networking tool. But it has severe limitations for consultants and experts.

1.  **Zero Design Control:** Your profile looks exactly the same as your competitor's.
2.  **Short Lifespan:** Your brilliant post disappears from the feed in 24 hours.
3.  **Distractions:** While looking at your profile, a client gets a notification from someone else.

## Deep Work Needs a Home

To win high-value contracts, you need a place to host "Deep Content." Case studies. White papers. Detailed methodology breakdowns.

YourHQ websites allow you to create a "Knowledge Hub." It signals sovereignty. It shows you aren't just an employee looking for a job; you are a business entity with your own infrastructure.
