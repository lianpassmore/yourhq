You built your business with your own hands. You've done the late nights and the hard mahi. So why are you paying rent to Instagram?

## The Landlord Problem

If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?  
If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?

Right now, you are a **Digital Tenant.**

The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.

And they DO evict people. Constantly.

### The $80,000 Eviction Notice (July 2025)

Let me tell you about Kellie Johnson, an Australian entrepreneur who sells wearable heat packs for endometriosis sufferers.

In July 2025, Meta (Facebook and Instagram's parent company) suddenly suspended all her accounts—business Instagram, personal Instagram, Facebook, even her podcast account with only three posts.

No warning. No clear explanation. Just a generic "you violated community guidelines" message.

**Her sales dropped from $133,000 in June to $50,000 in July. An $83,000 loss in a single month**.

It took over a week to get her accounts reinstated. By then, the damage was done.

And here's the kicker: She never found out what she supposedly did wrong. An AI moderator flagged something. That's it. No human review. No recourse until she escalated to the media and filed a complaint with the Small Business Ombudsman.

**She's not alone.** Another Australian business owner, Rochelle Marinato, had her pilates equipment business accounts suspended after posting a video of three dogs looking out a window. Her revenue dropped 75%, costing her an estimated $50,000.

This happened in 2025. Not five years ago. **This year.**

This isn't an edge case. This is the reality of being a digital tenant.

## The Slow Squeeze: When the Landlord Raises the Rent

Even if you don't get suspended, you're still getting squeezed.

Here's what's happening to organic reach on social media in 2025:

**Facebook:** Your posts now reach an average of **2.6-5.9% of your followers**. That means if you have 1,000 followers, only 26-59 people see your post.

Maybe. If you're lucky.

Some studies put Facebook's organic reach even lower—**as low as 1-2%**. That's 10-20 people out of 1,000.

**Instagram:** Average organic reach is **4.0-7.6% per post in 2025**. And it's falling—**Instagram's reach dropped 18% year-over-year in 2024**.

Let's do the maths:

You have 5,000 Instagram followers. You post a beautiful photo of your latest work. Instagram shows it to **200-380 people**.

Out of 5,000.

**That's 96% of your audience who never even see your post.**

### Why Is This Happening?

In 2018, Facebook made a deliberate algorithm change to prioritise "meaningful interactions" with friends and family over business content.

Translation: They want you to pay for ads.

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri stated in December 2022 that the platform's top priority is to "help people discover things they love"—meaning they're pushing discovery content (Reels, trending posts, paid ads) over content from accounts people already follow.

**By 2025, your posts are being deprioritised on purpose**.

Not because they're low quality. Not because your audience doesn't want to see them.

Because the platform makes more money when you pay for reach.

## The Real Numbers: What You're Actually Getting (2025 Data)

Let's compare what you get from "rented" media (social platforms) vs "owned" media (your website, email list).

### Conversion Rates: Social vs Website

**Social media traffic converts at 1.5%**.

**Website traffic converts at 2.7%**.

That means if you send 1,000 people to your Instagram profile, 15 become customers.

If you send 1,000 people to your website, 27 become customers.

**Your website converts at nearly double the rate of social media**.

Why? Because your website is a controlled environment designed for conversion. Social media is a distraction machine designed to keep people scrolling.

### ROI: Email vs Social Media (2025 Data)

**Email marketing returns $36-44 for every $1 spent**. That's a 3,600-4,400% ROI.

**Social media marketing returns $0.28 for every $1 spent**. That's a 28% ROI.

Read that again.

Email: $44 return per $1 invested.  
Social media: $0.28 return per $1 invested.

**Email marketing is 157 times more profitable than social media marketing**.

### Reach: The Platform You Control

When you send an email, it goes to everyone on your list. 100% delivery (assuming they haven't unsubscribed).

When you post on Instagram in 2025, it reaches 4-8% of your followers.

Let's say you have 5,000 Instagram followers and 500 email subscribers.

**Instagram post:** Reaches 200-400 people  
**Email:** Reaches 500 people

Your email list of 500 subscribers gives you better reach than an Instagram account with 5,000 followers.

## The Control Problem: You Don't Own Your Audience

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

**You don't own your Instagram followers. Instagram does.**

If Instagram bans your account tomorrow (accidentally or on purpose), you lose:
- All your followers
- All your content
- All your past conversations and relationships
- Your ability to contact any of those people

Gone. Instantly.

Same with Facebook. Same with TikTok. Same with any platform you don't control.

### What You DO Own

**Your website.** It's yours. The domain is registered in your name. The content is yours. The design is yours. No one can take it away.

**Your email list.** You export it. You own the data. You can move it to any email platform you want. No one can delete it.

**Your customer database.** Names, numbers, purchase history. It's yours. It lives on your systems, not Instagram's servers.

These are **assets**. Things you own. Things that have value. Things you can sell if you exit your business.

Instagram followers? Not an asset. They're borrowed visibility on someone else's platform.

## The Algorithm Game You Can't Win

Let me walk you through what it's like to play the algorithm game as a small business:

### January 2023:
Instagram pushes Reels. You adapt. You start making Reels. Your reach improves.

### June 2023:
Instagram changes the algorithm to prioritise "original content" and punish reposts. Your reach drops 30% because some of your Reels use trending audio (which Instagram now considers "unoriginal").

### October 2023:
Instagram announces they're prioritising "authentic connection" and reducing reach for "overly promotional" content. Your posts showcasing products? Now labelled promotional. Reach drops another 20%.

### March 2024:
Instagram shifts focus to AI-recommended content from accounts you don't follow. Your existing followers see even less of your content because Instagram is showing them random Reels from strangers instead.

### December 2024:
Instagram announces that organic reach dropped 18% year-over-year. You're now reaching 4% of your followers instead of 7%.

### 2025:
Organic reach continues to decline. Latest data shows you're reaching 4.0-7.6% at best. And Meta is still pushing businesses toward paid ads.

**This is the reality.** The goalposts move constantly. You play by the rules, the rules change, and you're back to square one.

And the entire time, Instagram is whispering in your ear: *"You know what would fix this? Paid ads."*

## The Diversification Strategy: Owned + Rented

Look—I'm not saying delete your Instagram account.

Social media has value. It's great for:
- Brand awareness
- Engagement and community building
- Showcasing your work visually
- Reaching new audiences

**But you can't rely on it exclusively**.

Here's the strategy that actually works in 2025:

### Use Social Media as the Top of the Funnel

Think of social media as your shopfront window. People walk past, see something interesting, and stop to look.

But you don't conduct the entire transaction through the window. You invite them INSIDE.

**Social media's job:** Attract attention. Build awareness. Create interest.

**Your website's job:** Convert that interest into bookings, sales, or enquiries.

### The Funnel That Works

1. **Instagram/Facebook:** Showcase your work. Tell your story. Engage with your audience.

2. **Call-to-Action:** "Link in bio" or "Visit our website" or "Book online"

3. **Your Website:** Professional presentation. Clear services. Online booking. Contact forms.

4. **Email Capture:** "Get 10% off your first visit" or "Download our free guide"

5. **Email Marketing:** Nurture the relationship. Stay top-of-mind. Offer value. Promote specials.

6. **Conversion:** They book. They buy. They become customers.

At every step, you're moving them from **rented space (social media) to owned space (your website and email list)**.

Once they're on your email list? You own that relationship. No algorithm can take it away.

## The Risk Reduction Framework

**Rented Media (Social Platforms):**
- ❌ Platform controls reach (2-8% organic in 2025)
- ❌ Algorithm changes constantly
- ❌ Can lose access without warning ($80K+ losses documented in 2025)
- ❌ Can't export your audience
- ❌ Lower conversion rates (1.5%)
- ❌ Lower ROI ($0.28 per $1)

**Owned Media (Website + Email):**
- ✅ You control 100% of reach
- ✅ Stable—no algorithm changes
- ✅ Can't be suspended or deleted
- ✅ Full data ownership and portability
- ✅ Higher conversion rates (2.7%)
- ✅ Higher ROI ($36-44 per $1)

## The 80/20 Rule for Digital Assets

Here's how I recommend Kiwi businesses think about digital marketing in 2025:

**80% of your effort should go into OWNED assets:**
- Your website
- Your email list
- Your customer database
- Your blog/content (hosted on YOUR site)

**20% of your effort should go into RENTED platforms:**
- Social media engagement
- Building awareness
- Driving traffic TO your owned assets

**Not the other way around.**

Most small businesses do the opposite. They spend 80% of their time on Instagram and 20% (if that) on their website.

Then they wonder why a single algorithm change tanks their business.

## The Long-Term Value: Assets vs Attention

Let's talk about what happens over time.

### Scenario A: Instagram-Only Business (5 Years)

**Year 1:** Build to 2,000 followers. Great engagement. Solid bookings.  
**Year 2:** Grow to 4,500 followers. Algorithm change. Reach drops. Have to post 3x as much for same results.  
**Year 3:** Reach 7,000 followers. Another algorithm change. Organic reach now 5%. Have to run ads to reach own followers.  
**Year 4:** Stuck at 8,000 followers. Organic reach 4%. Spending $500/month on ads just to maintain visibility.  
**Year 5:** Competitor steals your content. No recourse. Account gets flagged by AI for "suspicious activity." Suspended for 2 weeks. Revenue drops 60% during suspension.

**Total owned assets after 5 years:** Zero. If Instagram bans you, you start from scratch.

### Scenario B: Owned Assets First (5 Years)

**Year 1:** Build website. Start email list (200 subscribers). Use Instagram to drive traffic to website.  
**Year 2:** Email list grows to 800 subscribers. Website generates 40% of bookings organically (SEO).  
**Year 3:** Email list at 1,500 subscribers. Website ranks #1 for key local searches. Instagram still brings traffic, but website is the engine.  
**Year 4:** Email list at 2,500 subscribers. Website generates 65% of bookings. Instagram is supplementary.  
**Year 5:** Email list at 3,800 subscribers. If Instagram disappeared tomorrow, business would be fine. Website + email list = owned distribution.

**Total owned assets after 5 years:** 3,800 email subscribers. High-ranking website. Google Business Profile with reviews. Customer database. All transferable. All valuable if you sell the business.

Which scenario sounds better?

## It's Time to Become an Owner

Your website is your digital home. It's the one piece of the internet you actually control.

**69% of marketing experts believe owned media generates the best long-term results**.

Not social media. Not paid ads. **Owned media.**

Because owned media:
- Builds equity over time
- Can't be taken away
- Converts better (2.7% vs 1.5%)
- Returns more ($44 vs $0.28 per $1)
- Gives you 100% reach (not 4%)
- Survives algorithm changes, platform bans, and tech disruptions

Stop being a digital tenant. Stop paying rent to Mark Zuckerberg.

**Start owning your digital presence.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happened to businesses that got suspended from Instagram in 2025?**

In July 2025, multiple Australian businesses faced devastating losses from Meta account suspensions. Kellie Johnson's business lost $83,000 in one month ($133K to $50K), while Rochelle Marinato's revenue dropped 75% costing an estimated $50,000. Both suspensions were triggered by AI moderation with no clear explanation. This demonstrates the extreme risk of relying solely on rented platforms you don't control.

**How much has Instagram organic reach declined in 2025?**

As of 2025, Instagram organic reach averages just 4.0-7.6% of your followers per post, down 18% year-over-year. Facebook is even worse at 2.6-5.9%, with some businesses seeing as low as 1-2%. This means a business with 5,000 Instagram followers reaches only 200-380 people per post—96% of their audience never sees their content.

**What's the actual ROI difference between email marketing and social media in 2025?**

2025 data shows email marketing returns $36-44 for every $1 spent (3,600-4,400% ROI), while social media marketing returns just $0.28 per $1 (28% ROI). Email marketing is 157 times more profitable than social media. Additionally, website traffic converts at 2.7% compared to social media's 1.5%—nearly double the conversion rate.

**Do I still need social media if I have a website?**

Yes, but the relationship changes. Social media should drive traffic TO your owned assets (website, email list), not be your entire digital presence. Use social for brand awareness and engagement, but convert followers into email subscribers and website visitors you actually control. 69% of marketing experts believe owned media generates the best long-term results. The strategy is 80% owned assets, 20% rented platforms—not the reverse.

**What happens to my Instagram followers if my account gets banned?**

You lose everything instantly—all followers, all content, all conversations, and all ability to contact those people. Instagram owns your followers, not you. Unlike an email list you can export and own, Instagram data can't be transferred if you're suspended. This is why owned media (website + email list) is critical—no platform can take it away from you.
