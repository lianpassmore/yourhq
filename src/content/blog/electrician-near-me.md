When someone's hot water cylinder bursts at 7am, they don't ask around for recommendations. They grab their phone and Google "Plumber Whangārei."

If you aren't on page one, you don't exist.

## The Signal and the Noise

Google wants to give the user the most relevant, reliable answer. To rank you, its algorithm looks for three specific signals:

1.  **Relevance:** Does your website actually say "Plumber in Whangārei"? (You'd be shocked how many sites forget to list their service areas).
2.  **Distance:** Are you verified on Google Maps?
3.  **Prominence:** Do you have a fast, secure website that validates your business?

## A Facebook Page Isn't Enough

Facebook is a "walled garden." Google can't easily index everything inside it.

To rank locally, you need a dedicated domain (yourname.co.nz) with clean code that tells Google exactly **what** you do and **where** you do it.

We build our sites on Astro specifically because the code is lightweight and clean—Google's crawlers love it.
