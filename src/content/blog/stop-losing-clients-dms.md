"DM to book."

From an operations perspective, this phrase is a nightmare. It introduces **friction**.

1.  Client messages you at 8pm.
2.  You reply at 10am next day.
3.  Client is now busy and replies at 4pm.
4.  That slot is now gone.

This back-and-forth ping pong kills conversion rates.

## Remove the Friction

We build websites that integrate directly with systems like Fresha, Timely, or Calendly.

The client sees a slot. They book the slot. They pay the deposit. Done.

You wake up to a full calendar without typing a single message. That is the power of good infrastructure.
