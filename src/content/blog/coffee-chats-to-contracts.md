You know that feeling when a meeting goes *really* well?

You're walking back to your car thinking "Yep, nailed it." They loved your ideas. The chemistry was there. You can already picture the project kicking off.

And then... nothing.

They ghost. Or worse, they go with someone else. Someone less experienced. Someone who definitely wasn't as good in that room as you were.

What the hell happened?

## They Googled You in the Car Park

Here's what I learned the hard way: **The meeting is only half the sale.**

The other half? It happens when they pull out their phone before they've even left the car park.

They liked *you*. But now their logical brain is kicking in. They're looking for evidence to back up that gut feeling. Something concrete they can show their business partner, their spouse, their finance person when they get back to the office.

**If they land on a professional website that shows your methodology, testimonials, and track record?** Deal solidified.

**If they find nothing? Or worse, a half-finished site from 2018 that doesn't match the person they just met?** Doubt creeps in.

*"Are they really as experienced as they seemed?"*  
*"Why can't I find any examples of their work?"*  
*"Maybe I should keep looking..."*

## The Validation Loop: Why Humans Need Proof

Let's talk about what's actually happening in that car park moment.

### The Psychology of Post-Meeting Research

77% of B2B buyers research vendors before they even speak to sales. But here's the thing—**91% of buyers also come to initial meetings already familiar with the vendor**.

That means they've *already* Googled you once before the meeting. So why do they do it again after?

Because emotions and logic happen in different parts of the brain.

In the meeting, they connected with *you*—the human. They felt your energy, saw your expertise, trusted your vibe. That's the emotional sale, and it's powerful.

But when they walk away, the rational brain switches on. Now they need to *justify* that emotional decision with facts. Evidence. Proof that you're not just charismatic—you're credible.

### The Story That Made Me Think Differently

A friend of mine (also a consultant) told me about losing a deal that still haunts her.

She had one of the best discovery calls of her career. Over an hour long. The prospect was nodding, taking notes, asking all the right questions. At the end they said, "This is exactly what we need. I'll talk to my partner and get back to you."

Two weeks later: radio silence.

She followed up. Nothing.

Eventually, she found out through a mutual connection that they'd gone with someone else. Someone who charged *more* than her. Someone who had *less* experience.

The difference?

That person had a slick website with case studies, testimonials, and a clear breakdown of their process.

My friend's website at the time? A basic landing page with contact info and a vague "About Me" section.

She didn't lose that deal because she wasn't good enough. She lost it because **she didn't pass the car park test.**

## Your Website Isn't Lead Generation—It's Deal Validation

I used to think websites were about *attracting* clients. And sure, SEO and discoverability matter.

But here's the thing: **Your website's biggest job isn't bringing people to you. It's closing the deals you've already started.**

It's the thing that validates you when you're not in the room.

76% of people check your online presence before deciding whether to work with you. They're not just browsing—they're actively looking for reasons to trust you or reasons to walk away.

Your website is the silent partner in every sales conversation you have. Make sure it's working *for* you, not against you.

## What They're Actually Looking For (And How Long You Have)

Imagine this: Someone's sitting in their car. They just had coffee with you. They pull out their phone and type your name into Google.

What do they see?

They're not reading your entire About page. Let's be real—nobody has time for that.

They're scanning. Fast. Looking for three specific things:

### 1. Proof You're Legit

- Client testimonials (with real names and companies, not "J.S. from Auckland")
- Case studies that show actual results
- Evidence of expertise (speaking gigs, publications, certifications)

### 2. Clarity on What You Actually Do

- Your methodology or framework (does it have a name? Is it clear?)
- Your process (what happens when someone works with you?)
- Who you work with (are they in the right place?)

### 3. Authentic Voice

- Does your website sound like the person they just met?
- Is it full of corporate jargon, or does it feel human?
- Can they *hear* your voice when they read it?

If your digital self matches your physical self? You've got them.

If there's a mismatch—or worse, if they can't find you at all? You've lost them.

And here's the kicker: **You have about 15 seconds to make that impression**. That's how long it takes for someone to decide whether your website is credible or not.

## The Three Types of Consulting Websites (And Which One Closes Deals)

I've seen three types of consultant websites in my work. Only one of them actually closes deals.

### Type 1: The Ghost

No website, or just a LinkedIn profile. Maybe a Facebook page from 2019.

**What prospects think:** *"Are they even still in business?"*

### Type 2: The Template

Basic site. Generic stock photos. Services listed but no personality. Could be anyone's website.

**What prospects think:** *"Okay, they exist... but I still don't really know who they are."*

### Type 3: The Authority

Clear methodology. Real testimonials. Authentic voice. Shows up exactly as they showed up in person.

**What prospects think:** *"Yes. This is the person I need."*

Which one are you?

## So What Do You Do About It?

Look—I get it. Building a website feels overwhelming when you're already drowning in client work (or hustling to land it). The last thing you want is another big project on your plate.

But here's the brutal truth: **Every great coffee meeting, every warm handshake, every "let's definitely work together" conversation comes down to that car park moment.**

You can be brilliant in the room and still lose the deal if your website doesn't back you up.

### Where to Start

If you're reading this thinking *"Shit, my website is definitely Type 1 or 2,"* here's what to prioritise:

1. **Get testimonials up** (even just 2-3 is better than zero)
2. **Clarify your process** (what are the steps someone goes through when they work with you?)
3. **Match your voice** (if you're funny in person, don't be corporate online)
4. **Make it easy to contact you** (no one wants to hunt for a "Work With Me" link)

You don't need perfection. You need *validation*.

Because the goal isn't to impress people with flashy design (though that doesn't hurt). The goal is to make them feel confident they made the right call in that meeting.

## The Bottom Line

Your website is doing one of two things right now:

**It's either validating your expertise and closing deals...**

**...or it's costing you clients you should've won.**

Every prospect who walks out of a meeting with you is going to Google you. It's not a matter of if—it's a matter of when. And what they find in that moment will either seal the deal or kill it.

So make sure your digital self shows up as strong as your real self does.

Because you're too good at what you do to lose deals in a car park.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do prospects research consultants after meetings?**

Prospects research consultants after meetings because they need logical evidence to support their emotional decision. While face-to-face meetings create trust and connection, buyers need concrete proof—like testimonials, case studies, and clear methodologies—to justify their choice to partners, stakeholders, or themselves.

**What percentage of B2B buyers research vendors online?**

77% of B2B buyers conduct their own research before speaking to sales representatives, and 91% arrive at meetings already familiar with the vendor. Additionally, 76% of consumers check a business's online presence before deciding to engage with them.

**How long do prospects spend reviewing consultant websites?**

Most prospects spend approximately 15 seconds deciding whether a website is credible. They scan quickly for specific elements: testimonials, clear service descriptions, and authentic voice. This means your website needs to communicate expertise and credibility immediately—not after visitors dig through multiple pages.

**What's more important for consultants: SEO or website credibility?**

Both matter, but for consultants, **credibility is more critical**. While SEO helps new prospects find you, website credibility closes deals with people who've already met you. Your website's primary job is validation, not attraction. Focus first on testimonials, clear methodology, and authentic voice—then optimise for search.

**What should be on a consulting website to close more deals?**

A deal-closing consultant website needs three core elements: (1) proof of credibility through client testimonials and case studies with real results, (2) clear explanation of your methodology and process, and (3) authentic voice that matches how you show up in person. These elements work together to validate the emotional connection made during in-person meetings.
