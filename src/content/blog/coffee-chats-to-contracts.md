You have a great coffee meeting. You shake hands. The vibe is good.

What happens next?

The prospect walks to their car, sits in the driver's seat, pulls out their phone, and Googles you.

## The Validation Loop

This moment is the **Validation Loop**. They liked *you*, but now their brain is looking for logical evidence to back up that emotional decision.

If they find a slick, authoritative website that outlines your methodology and showcases testimonials, the deal is solidified.

If they find nothing, doubt creeps in. *"Are they really as experienced as they said?"*

Your website isn't just lead generation. It's deal validation. Ensure your digital self matches your physical self.
