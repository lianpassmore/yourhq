When you sell a business, you aren't just selling a customer list. You are selling a machine.

Investors and buyers look for systems. They want to know: *If the owner leaves, does the marketing stop working?*

## The Digital Asset

A well-ranking, professional website is a tangible asset.
*   It generates leads automatically (a system).
*   It holds the brand value (intellectual property).
*   It houses the customer data (analytics).

If your "marketing" is just you posting on your personal Facebook, that's not an asset. That's a job.

Building a proper digital HQ increases the valuation of your company because it proves the business can exist without you.
