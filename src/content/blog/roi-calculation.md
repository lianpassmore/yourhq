You're thinking about getting a website. But $995 is real money.

Will it actually make you money back? Or is it just another expense?

Here is the short answer: **For most tradies, a website pays for itself within 2-4 weeks.**

Here is the long answer, with the maths.

## The Payback Calculation

**Cost of Website:**
*   Setup: $995
*   Monthly: $149
*   **Year 1 Total:** ~$2,783

**Value of One Job:**
Let's be conservative. Average tradie job: **$2,500**.

**The Maths:**
$995 setup ÷ $2,500 job = **0.4 jobs.**

**One job pays off the setup twice over.**
Two jobs pay for the entire first year.

If your website brings in just **2 jobs in 12 months**, you have made a profit.

## Where the Leads Come From

"But will it bring in work?"

**Current Reality:** You rely on Word of Mouth (70%) and Facebook (20%). You are missing the 97% of people searching Google.

**With a Website:** You still get Word of Mouth. But you add Google Search.
*   Conservatively: 15 extra leads/month.
*   Close rate: 40%.
*   **Extra jobs: 6 per month.**

**6 jobs × $2,500 = $15,000/month in additional revenue.**

Your website cost $995. You paid it off by lunchtime on Day 3.

## The Three Ways It Pays Off

1.  **New Leads (Direct Revenue):** People finding you on Google who didn't know you existed.
2.  **Better Conversion (Saved Revenue):** People who got your quote, Googled you, saw a pro site, and chose you over the cheaper guy.
3.  **Premium Pricing (Higher Revenue):** Tradies with websites charge 22-33% more. That's pure margin.

## The Compound Effect

*   **Month 1:** Site goes live. 1-2 extra jobs. Setup paid off.
*   **Month 6:** You have 40 Google reviews. You rank higher. 10+ extra jobs/month.
*   **Month 12:** You are the dominant player in your suburb. You raise prices.

The website doesn't pay off once. It pays off every single month, compounding over time.

## The Bottom Line

A website costs about $3,000 a year.
It typically generates $100,000+ in additional revenue.

**ROI: 30x to 50x.**

The question isn't "Can I afford a website?"
The question is "How much am I losing every week I don't have one?"

At 6 jobs a month, you're losing **$3,750 per week**.

Stop leaving money on the table.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if a tradie website doesn't bring in any work?**
For a website to lose money, it would need to generate fewer than 0.4 jobs in an entire year—less than one job. Given that 97% of people search online for local services and hundreds of people Google your trade in your area every month, generating zero leads from a properly built website is statistically near-impossible. Even the most conservative scenarios show payback within weeks.

**How does a website compare to Google Ads for tradies?**
Google Ads stop generating leads the moment you stop paying. A website is a digital asset you own that builds authority and organic rankings over time. While Google Ads can deliver quick leads at $20-$50+ per click, a website generates free organic leads month after month. Long-term, the ROI of a website is significantly higher—typically 30-50x your investment annually.

**Will a website help if I'm already fully booked?**
Yes—arguably even more so. When you're fully booked, a website gives you lead abundance, which gives you selectivity. Instead of taking every job, you cherry-pick the highest-value work, decline low-margin jobs, and raise your rates. Tradies with websites and lead abundance consistently earn more while working fewer hours.

**How long does it take for a tradie website to start generating leads?**
Most professionally built websites start generating enquiries within the first 1-4 weeks. Initial leads come from improved credibility (people Googling you after a referral). Organic Google search leads build over 3-6 months as your site gains authority and reviews accumulate. By month 6-12, a well-optimised site typically generates 10+ leads per month.
