Your mate just got new signwriting on his van. Fresh logo. Clean colours. Looks sharp.

Now you're looking at your faded van with the logo you made in Word back in 2015. You think: *"Maybe I need to rebrand."*

You get quotes. Logo, van, uniforms, cards. Suddenly you're looking at **$10,000**.

Is it worth it? Or is it just expensive ego-stroking?

## The Rebranding Trap

Here's the hard truth: **Branding without visibility is like wearing a nice suit in an empty room.** You look great, but nobody is there to see you.

A beautiful logo doesn't help if customers can't find you on Google.
Professional van wraps don't help if people searching "plumber near me" don't see your name.

**Branding is the last 10% of the equation. Not the first.**

## The Right Order to Invest

If you want to look professional AND make money, here is the order:

### 1. Get Found (Visibility)
*   Google Business Profile.
*   Professional Website.
*   Google Reviews (40+).
*   **Cost:** ~$3,000. **Impact:** You actually get leads.

### 2. Build Trust (Credibility)
*   Photos of your work.
*   Testimonials.
*   Qualifications displayed.
*   **Cost:** Included in website build. **Impact:** Leads turn into customers.

### 3. Look Professional (Branding)
*   Logo, Van, Uniforms.
*   **Cost:** $5,000+. **Impact:** Polish.

Most tradies do Step 3 first and skip Step 1. That's why they look good but stay broke.

## When Rebranding is a Waste of Money

*   **You don't have a website:** If they can't find you online, the logo doesn't matter.
*   **Your reviews are weak:** A fancy brand can't fix a 3-star rating.
*   **You're just bored:** If your current brand is "fine" and clear, it's not holding you back.

## When Rebranding is Worth It

*   **You're ready to scale:** You have the leads, you have the systems, now you want the premium image to match your premium prices.
*   **Your current brand is actively bad:** If your logo looks like clip-art from 1995 or your name is confusing, fix it.

## The Bottom Line

Spend $3,000 on a website first. It works 24/7 generating leads.
Spend time getting Google Reviews. They build trust.

Then, and only then, spend the money on the fancy van wrap. Don't put the cart before the horse.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I get a website or rebrand first?**
Website first. Always. A website makes you visible to the 97% of people who search online before hiring a tradie. Branding is polish—it enhances an existing presence but can't create one. Until you're showing up on Google, no amount of logo redesign will generate leads.

**Does my logo actually matter to customers?**
Less than you think. Research shows customers hire based on trust signals like reviews, response time, and professional presentation—not logo design. Very few people choose a plumber because of a nice logo. A clean, consistent look helps, but it's nowhere near as important as being findable online.

**How much should a tradie spend on branding?**
Focus your first $3,000 on visibility—a professional website and Google Business Profile. Save the big branding spend ($5,000+) for when you're scaling, have consistent lead flow, and want to match your image to your premium pricing. Branding before visibility is money wasted.
