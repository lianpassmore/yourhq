We hear it all the time. *"I'll just whip something up on Wix this weekend."*

Six months later, the site still isn't live. Or it is live, but it looks... slightly wonky on mobile. And it takes 4 seconds to load.

## The "Free" Trap

DIY platforms pitch themselves as cheap. But let's look at the real cost.

**1. Your Hourly Rate**
If you charge $80/hour for your services, and you spend 40 hours fighting with a drag-and-drop builder (which is average), that "free" website just cost you **$3,200 in lost billable time**.

**2. The "Templates" Look**
Templates are great, until you realize 400 other businesses in New Zealand are using the exact same one. It doesn't look like *you*.

**3. The Speed Penalty**
Google hates slow websites. Bloated DIY code often loads slowly, which hurts your ranking.

## The Middle Ground: Infrastructure + Warmth

You usually have two choices:
1.  **DIY:** Cheap, but stressful and time-consuming.
2.  **Agency:** Professional, but costs $10k+ and takes 8 weeks.

**We built YourHQ to be option 3.**

We use professional code (the same tech Silicon Valley uses), but we package it as a service. You pay a setup fee ($995) and a monthly "caretaker" fee ($149).

We build it. We host it. We fix it when it breaks. You own it.

Stop wrestling with technology. You have a business to run.
