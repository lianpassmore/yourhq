You've built your reputation on the tools. You show up on time, you do the hard mahi, and for years, that was enough. Your phone rang because Barry told Steve you were a good bloke.

But lately? It's a bit quieter. Or worse—the only calls you're getting are price-shoppers and tyre kickers.

Here's the hard truth: **Word of mouth has moved online.**

## The "Background Check" Generation

Even when someone recommends you, the first thing a potential client does is pull out their phone.

They type your name into Google.

**97% of people learn about local businesses online first**. That includes tradies, builders, sparkies, plumbers—all of it.

### Scenario A: You Have a Professional Web Presence

They find a crisp, fast-loading website. They see photos of your recent deck builds. They see your service areas clearly listed. They see a "Book Now" button or a contact form. They see reviews from real clients.

They trust you immediately. They call. They book.

### Scenario B: You Have No Web Presence

They find... nothing. Maybe an old Yellow Pages listing. Maybe a Facebook page you haven't updated since 2019. Maybe just your phone number with no context.

They start to wonder: *"Are they still in business? Are they cowboy operators? Why don't they have a website?"*

**62% of customers will ignore a business without a website or web presence**.

Not "consider them less." Not "prefer someone else if possible."

**Ignore. Completely.**

They move on to the next name on the list—the one WITH a website.

## The Numbers Don't Lie: What's Happening in NZ Right Now

Let's look at what's actually happening in Aotearoa in 2025.

**Only 53% of NZ businesses have a website**. That means 47% of Kiwi businesses are operating without a dedicated website.

And among sole traders (which includes most tradies)? The gap is even wider.

But here's what makes this dangerous:

**56% of people stated they wouldn't trust a business without a website**.

Let me spell that out: **Half of NZ businesses don't have websites, but more than half of customers won't trust a business without one.**

That's a massive gap. And if you're on the wrong side of it, you're losing work to competitors who figured this out years ago.

### The Recommendation Doesn't Work Like It Used To

Let's say Barry recommends you to his mate Steve.

**Old way (pre-2015):**
- Barry: "Call Johnno, he's a good sparkie."
- Steve: "Sweet, what's his number?"
- Steve calls. Books. Job done.

**New way (2025):**
- Barry: "Call Johnno, he's a good sparkie."
- Steve: "Cheers, what's his last name?"
- Steve Googles: "Johnno electrician Hamilton"
- **If he finds nothing credible, he doesn't call.**

**91% of homeowners rely on online reviews before choosing a contractor**. Even if you were recommended by a mate.

**81% of consumers research a business online before making a purchase**.

The recommendation gets you ON the list. But the online presence is what gets you the CALL.

## The Credibility Gap

We call this the Credibility Gap.

Your work is solid. Your handshake is firm. Your reputation among people who know you is great.

But your digital presence looks like a ghost town.

**And high-value clients notice.**

### Who Are High-Value Clients?

The ones who:
- Pay invoices on time
- Don't haggle over $50
- Book you for full jobs, not just tiny repairs
- Refer you to their mates (who also become good clients)
- Value quality over lowest price

**These clients expect professionalism at every touchpoint**.

When they Google you and find nothing—or worse, find an outdated Facebook page—it triggers doubt.

Not about your skills. About your business.

*"If they can't even maintain a website, how organized are they really?"*

*"If they're not investing in their business, should I invest my money with them?"*

### The Competitor Advantage

Meanwhile, your competitor—who might not even be as skilled as you—has a professional website. Photos of their work. Client testimonials. Clear contact info. Online booking.

**They're winning jobs not because they're better tradespeople. But because they LOOK more professional.**

And in 2025, looking professional online is part of BEING professional.

## What Changed? Why Did Word of Mouth Stop Working?

Word of mouth didn't stop working entirely. But it evolved.

### The Old Word of Mouth Model:

1. Do good work
2. Client tells their mates
3. Mates call you
4. Repeat

This worked when:
- People made decisions based on personal recommendations alone
- There was no easy way to "verify" someone
- The phone book was the main directory
- Competition was mostly local

### The New Word of Mouth Model (2025):

1. Do good work
2. Client tells their mates
3. **Mates Google you**
4. **If you pass the "online credibility check," they call**
5. Repeat

**Word of mouth now starts the process. Your online presence closes it.**

### Why This Shift Happened:

**Mobile search explosion:** 46% of all Google searches have local intent. "Electrician near me." "Plumber Hamilton." "Deck builder Waikato."

**Review culture:** People expect to see reviews before hiring anyone for anything. **98% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses**.

**Instant verification:** In 2005, you had to trust Barry's recommendation. In 2025, you can Google Johnno, check his reviews, see his work, and verify he's legit—all in 3 minutes while sitting on the couch.

**Competition increased:** More tradies. More visibility online for those who invest in it. If you're not visible, you're not competing.

## The "Near Me" Search Revolution

Here's something that's completely changed the game for local tradies:

**"Near me" mobile searches have increased 900%+ in just two years**.

Searches like:
- "Plumber near me"
- "Electrician near me open now"
- "Builder near me today"

**78% of location-based mobile searches result in an offline purchase**.

Translation: When someone searches for a tradie on their phone, they're READY to book. They're not browsing. They're not researching. They need someone NOW.

**If you're not showing up in those searches, you're invisible.**

### How Do You Show Up?

1. **Google Business Profile** (free, but you need to claim and optimize it)
2. **A website** (so Google knows you're legitimate and active)
3. **Reviews** (signals to Google that you're trustworthy)

**64% of consumers use Google Business Profiles to find contact details**. And **48% of Google Business Profile interactions are website visits**.

They find you on Google Maps. They click through to your website. They book.

No website? They click through and find... nothing. They move on to the next name.

## The Hidden Costs of Not Having a Website

You might think: *"I don't need a website. I'm busy enough."*

But are you busy with the RIGHT jobs?

Here's what happens when you rely solely on word of mouth and no online presence:

### 1. You Attract Price Shoppers, Not Quality Clients

Without a website, you can't showcase:
- Your premium work
- Your qualifications and certifications
- Your process and quality standards
- Client testimonials

So the clients who find you are the ones who are just looking for "a sparkie" or "a plumber." Not "THE sparkie who specializes in commercial fit-outs" or "THE plumber who does high-end bathroom renovations."

**You become a commodity. And commodities compete on price.**

### 2. You Can't Scale Beyond Your Personal Network

**Word of mouth is limited in reach**. It works only with people who know you, and the people who know *them*. Once you're more than two degrees removed from the source, word of mouth rapidly fades.

You're stuck at a certain size because your network only extends so far.

Meanwhile, a tradie with a strong online presence can:
- Reach customers in new suburbs
- Attract clients who've never heard of them
- Scale beyond personal referrals

### 3. You Miss After-Hours Bookings

Remember: **46% of service bookings happen outside business hours**.

Someone's couch-surfing at 8pm. Their hot water cylinder is leaking. They Google "plumber Hamilton."

If you don't have a website with contact info and a booking form? They're calling someone else.

**64% of consumers have used Google Business Profiles to find contact details**. But if your GBP doesn't link to a website with clear service info? They move on.

### 4. You Lose Trust Before You Even Get the Call

**56% of people won't trust a business without a website**.

Even if Barry recommended you. Even if you're the best in the business.

If they Google you and find nothing, doubt creeps in.

### 5. You're Invisible to the Next Generation

Millennials and Gen Z (who are now in their 30s and buying homes) **expect businesses to have an online presence**.

They don't use the Yellow Pages. They don't ask around at the pub. They Google, they check reviews, they look at websites.

**If you're not online, you don't exist to them.**

## What You Actually Need (It's Simpler Than You Think)

You don't need a fancy "digital experience." You don't need an app. You don't need to become an influencer.

**You need a digital business card that works.**

### The Essentials:

**1. A Professional Website**
- Clean, fast-loading (under 3 seconds)
- Mobile-responsive (80%+ of tradie searches happen on mobile)
- Shows your services clearly
- Has photos of your work
- Lists your service areas
- Has contact info and a form

**2. Google Business Profile**
- Claimed and verified
- Complete info (hours, phone, services, photos)
- Regular review requests from happy clients
- Linked to your website

**3. Consistency**
- Same business name, address, phone across all platforms (Google, website, social)
- Active presence (not an abandoned Facebook page from 2019)

That's it.

You don't need to post on Instagram daily. You don't need TikTok. You don't need a blog (though it helps with SEO).

**You just need the basics done properly.**

## The ROI: What a Website Actually Returns

Let's talk money.

**A local restaurant saw a 30% increase in reservations after launching their website with online ordering**.

**Construction contractors using local SEO see more high-intent traffic, shorter sales cycles, and better client identification**.

### Real Example: Hamilton Tradie

Let's say you're a sparkie in Hamilton.

**Without a website:**
- You rely on word of mouth
- You get 2-3 calls per week from referrals
- Mix of small jobs and larger jobs
- Some price shoppers

**With a professional website + Google Business Profile:**
- You show up for "electrician Hamilton," "electrician near me," "emergency electrician Waikato"
- You get 5-7 calls per week (referrals PLUS online searches)
- Higher-quality leads (they've seen your work, read your reviews, know your pricing)
- Fewer tyre kickers (your website filters them out)

**Extra 3-4 jobs per week × $500 average job = $1,500-$2,000 extra per week**

**That's $6,000-$8,000 extra per month. $72,000-$96,000 per year.**

Your website costs you $995 + GST setup + $149/month + GST = $2,783 + GST in Year 1.

**ROI: 2,590-3,450%**

Even if we're SUPER conservative and say you only get 1 extra job per month at $500, that's $6,000/year.

**Still a 116% ROI.**

## Stop Gambling on the Phone

Here's the reality:

The phone used to ring just because you did good work.

Now, the phone rings because:
1. You do good work (still essential)
2. **AND** someone can find you online
3. **AND** you look professional when they do
4. **AND** they can easily contact you

**Word of mouth gets you ON the list. Your online presence gets you the CALL.**

You don't need to become a digital marketing expert. You just need the basics sorted.

At YourHQ, we build sites for sparkies, builders, and chippies who hate admin.

We get it sorted in 5-7 days so you can get back on the tools.

**What do I actually need for my tradie business online?**

Three essentials: (1) A professional website (fast-loading, mobile-responsive, with services, photos, and contact form), (2) Claimed and optimized Google Business Profile (complete info, photos, reviews, linked to website), and (3) Consistency across platforms.
