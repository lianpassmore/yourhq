You have curated a beautiful feed. Your balayage transitions are seamless. Your Reels are trending.

But deep down, you have a nagging worry.

**You don't own your followers.** Mark Zuckerberg does.

## The Digital Landlord

Right now, you are a **Digital Tenant**. You are building your castle on rented land.

The landlord (Meta) sets the rules.
The landlord decides who sees your posts.
The landlord can evict you (ban your account) whenever they want.

We’ve seen it happen. An algorithm update rolls out, reach drops by 40%, and suddenly the DMs stop coming in.

## Move Your Clients to Your House

We aren't saying delete Instagram. It's a great marketing tool. But it shouldn't be your *only* tool.

You need a home base. A place where:
1. **You control the experience.** No ads for competitors popping up next to your work.
2. **Booking is seamless.** No more "DM to book" ping-pong.
3. **You build authority.** A portfolio that stays organized, not buried in a feed.

## From Renter to Owner

A website is insurance for your brand. It signals that you are an established, premium salon—not just an influencer.

We build beautiful, portfolio-heavy sites for creatives. We handle the tech; you handle the art.
