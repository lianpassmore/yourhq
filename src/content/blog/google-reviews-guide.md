You've got 50+ reviews on Facebook. Customers love you. But on Google? Twelve reviews.

And you know it matters. You know Google uses reviews to decide who ranks #1. But every time you think about asking for a review, you freeze.

It feels awkward. *"Hey, uh, would you mind leaving me a review?"* Cringe.

So you stay stuck at 12 reviews while your competitor hits 100.

Here's the thing: There's a way to get reviews consistently without feeling like a dodgy car salesman.

## Why Google Reviews Matter More Than Facebook

When someone Googles "electrician Auckland," Facebook doesn't show up. **Google shows Google.**

*   **98%** of consumers read online reviews for local businesses.
*   **Businesses with 50+ reviews** earn 20% more revenue than those with fewer.

The top 3 local search results have an average of **47 reviews**. If you've got 12, you're not competing.

## The Right Way to Ask (Scripts That Work)

Here are actual words you can use that don't sound desperate.

**Verbal Script (Face to face, end of job):**
> "Cheers for that. Hey, if you've got 30 seconds, a Google review would really help me out. I'll text you the link so you don't have to search for it."

Why this works:
*   "30 seconds" sets expectations.
*   "I'll text you the link" removes the friction.

**Follow-Up Text (Send within 2 hours):**
> "Hey [Name], thanks again for today. If you've got a minute, a quick Google review would mean a lot. Here's the link: [LINK]. No worries if not. Cheers, [Your Name]"

## The Friction-Free System

Most tradies make it too hard. *"Just look me up on Google."* That's 6 steps. They won't do it.

**The Fix:** The One-Tap Review Link.
1.  Go to your Google Business Profile.
2.  Click "Get more reviews."
3.  Copy the link.

Send THAT link. One tap, they are typing.

## The Automation Approach

If you have a professional website, we build this in.
1.  Job marked complete.
2.  Automated text goes out 2 hours later with the link.
3.  If no review after 3 days, automated gentle reminder.

You literally never think about it. The system handles everything. Businesses using automated systems see **4-5x more reviews** than those relying on memory.

## The Compound Effect

*   **Month 1:** You ask every customer. You get 4 reviews. Total: 16.
*   **Month 6:** You're at 40 reviews. You start showing up in the Map Pack.
*   **Month 12:** You're at 80 reviews. You are outranking competitors who have been in business for 20 years.

The tradie who starts today and gets 5 reviews a month wins. The tradie who puts it off stays invisible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many Google reviews does a tradie need to rank?**
The top 3 local search results on Google have an average of 47 reviews. To compete for visibility in the Map Pack, aim for 40-50 reviews as a starting target. But don't stop there—more reviews mean higher rankings, more trust, and a bigger buffer against the occasional negative review.

**When is the best time to ask for a Google review?**
Within 24 hours of finishing the job, while the experience is fresh. Response rates drop by roughly half if you wait a week. The ideal approach is to mention it face-to-face at job completion, then follow up with a direct review link via text within 2 hours. Making it easy is the key—one tap, not six steps.

**What should I do if I get a bad Google review?**
Respond professionally and promptly. Acknowledge the concern, offer to resolve it offline, and keep your tone calm. Volume is your best protection—one 1-star review is devastating on a 10-review profile but barely moves the needle on a 100-review profile. Focus on consistently generating positive reviews rather than stressing over the occasional negative one.

**Can I pay for or incentivise Google reviews?**
No. Google's terms of service prohibit offering incentives for reviews, and they actively detect and remove fake reviews. The best approach is to make the process easy (direct link, one tap) and ask consistently after every job. Authentic reviews from real customers are what build lasting trust and rankings.
