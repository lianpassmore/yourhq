You've got 50+ reviews on Facebook. Customers love you. But on Google? Twelve reviews.

And you know it matters. You know Google uses reviews to decide who ranks #1. But every time you think about asking for a review, you freeze.

It feels awkward. *"Hey, uh, would you mind leaving me a review?"* Cringe.

So you stay stuck at 12 reviews while your competitor hits 100.

Here's the thing: There's a way to get reviews consistently without feeling like a dodgy car salesman.

## Why Google Reviews Matter More Than Facebook

When someone Googles "electrician Auckland," Facebook doesn't show up. **Google shows Google.**

*   **98%** of consumers read online reviews for local businesses.
*   **Businesses with 50+ reviews** earn 20% more revenue than those with fewer.

The top 3 local search results have an average of **47 reviews**. If you've got 12, you're not competing.

## The Right Way to Ask (Scripts That Work)

Here are actual words you can use that don't sound desperate.

**Verbal Script (Face to face, end of job):**
> "Cheers for that. Hey, if you've got 30 seconds, a Google review would really help me out. I'll text you the link so you don't have to search for it."

Why this works:
*   "30 seconds" sets expectations.
*   "I'll text you the link" removes the friction.

**Follow-Up Text (Send within 2 hours):**
> "Hey [Name], thanks again for today. If you've got a minute, a quick Google review would mean a lot. Here's the link: [LINK]. No worries if not. Cheers, [Your Name]"

## The Friction-Free System

Most tradies make it too hard. *"Just look me up on Google."* That's 6 steps. They won't do it.

**The Fix:** The One-Tap Review Link.
1.  Go to your Google Business Profile.
2.  Click "Get more reviews."
3.  Copy the link.

Send THAT link. One tap, they are typing.

## The Automation Approach

If you have a professional website, we build this in.
1.  Job marked complete.
2.  Automated text goes out 2 hours later with the link.
3.  If no review after 3 days, automated gentle reminder.

You literally never think about it. The system handles everything. Businesses using automated systems see **4-5x more reviews** than those relying on memory.

## The Compound Effect

*   **Month 1:** You ask every customer. You get 4 reviews. Total: 16.
*   **Month 6:** You're at 40 reviews. You start showing up in the Map Pack.
*   **Month 12:** You're at 80 reviews. You are outranking competitors who have been in business for 20 years.

The tradie who starts today and gets 5 reviews a month wins. The tradie who puts it off stays invisible.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**How many Google reviews do I need?**
Top 3 results average 47 reviews. Aim for 40-50 to compete, then keep building.

**What's the best time to ask?**
Within 24 hours of finishing the job. Response rates drop by half if you wait a week.

**What if I get a bad review?**
Respond professionally. Volume is your protection—one 1-star review ruins a 10-review profile, but barely touches a 100-review profile.
