*"I'll just do it myself on Wix."*

Every tradie has thought it. It's cheap. There are templates. It can't be that hard.

Six months later: The site is half-finished. It looks like a template. It's not on Google. You've wasted 3 weekends.

I'm not here to trash Wix. But for a busy tradie? Let's do the real maths.

## The True Cost of DIY

**1. The Platform Cost**
Wix or Squarespace business plans cost roughly **$450-$500/year**. It's not free.

**2. Your Time (The Big One)**
Average time for a beginner to build a decent site: **40 hours**.
What is your time worth? If you charge $90/hr, that's **$3,600** in lost billable time.

**3. The Learning Curve**
Figuring out mobile layout, SEO settings, domain connection... add another 10 hours. **$900.**

**Total Year 1 Cost of DIY: ~$5,000+**

Suddenly, paying a pro $995 to set it up doesn't look expensive. It looks like a bargain.

## The Results Gap

Cost aside, there's the quality issue.

**The Template Problem:** Templates look good with professional stock photos. They look terrible with your phone photos and the text you wrote at 11pm. 94% of first impressions are design-related.

**The SEO Problem:** Do you know how to write meta descriptions? Structure headers? Set up XML sitemaps? Professional builders do this automatically. DIYers usually skip it. Result: **You don't rank on Google.**

**The Speed Problem:** Drag-and-drop builders generate bloated code. Slow sites kill conversions. 53% of mobile users leave sites that take >3 seconds to load.

## The Professional Alternative (Productised)

**YourHQ Launch Package:**
*   **Cost:** $995 setup.
*   **Time from you:** 15 minutes (phone call).
*   **Result:** Custom design, SEO built-in, under 1 second load time.

**3-Year Cost Comparison:**
*   **DIY (Wix):** ~$8,100 (Platform fees + Your wasted hours)
*   **Pro (YourHQ):** ~$6,300 (Setup + Monthly hosting/support)

Professional is actually **CHEAPER** when you value your time. And you get a result that actually makes money.

## The Bottom Line

You're a plumber/builder/sparkie. You're not a web designer.

The tradies making real money aren't spending their weekends wrestling with Wix. They're spending weekends with their families while their pro website generates leads.

Stop stepping over dollars to pick up pennies.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Wix really that bad for tradies?**
It's not "bad," it's just inefficient. It takes 40-60 hours of your time to get a result that is usually slower and ranks worse than a pro site built in 5 days.

**Why do DIY websites not rank on Google?**
SEO requires specific technical knowledge (schema, site speed, structure). Most DIYers don't know this, so they build "invisible" websites.

**How long does it really take to build a website myself?**
For a complete beginner to build something professional? 40-80 hours. Plus ongoing maintenance time every month.
