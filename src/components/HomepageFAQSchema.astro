        "@type": "Answer",

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "With Wix or Squarespace, you do all the work yourself—40+ hours of building, learning, and troubleshooting. With YourHQ, we do everything for you in 5 days using faster, more secure technology. Plus, you get unlimited updates and annual refreshes included, not extra charges."
