          <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>To build and maintain your website, we collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Identity:</strong> Name, contact details, and business descriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> Images, text, logos, and files you upload to our Shared Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> Audio recordings from your "Drive-Home Interview" with our AI agent.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Analytics on how your website performs (if on the Growth plan).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Our Technology Stack & Data Storage</h3>
          <p>We believe in radical transparency regarding where your data lives. We use best-in-class infrastructure to ensure speed and security.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-none pl-0 space-y-4">
            <li class="flex gap-3">
              <span class="font-bold text-carbon min-w-[120px]">Supabase:</span>
              <span>We use Supabase for our database. We implement <strong>Row Level Security (RLS)</strong> policies, meaning your data is cryptographically segregated. Only authorized users (you and our admins) can access your specific records.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-3">
              <span class="font-bold text-carbon min-w-[120px]">Stripe:</span>

            </li>
            <li class="flex gap-3">
              <span class="font-bold text-carbon min-w-[120px]">ElevenLabs:</span>
              <span>Used for our AI Interview Agent. Your voice data is processed solely to transcribe information for your website build. We do not use your voice to clone your identity.</span>

          </ul>

          <h3>3. Data Sovereignty (Ownership)</h3>
          <p>This is where we differ from platforms like Facebook or Instagram:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You own your content.</strong> We claim no intellectual property rights over the text and images you provide.</li>
            <li><strong>You own your customer list.</strong> Any leads generated by your website belong 100% to you. We do not mine, sell, or share your customer data.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability.</strong> If you choose to leave YourHQ (after the minimum term), we provide you with a static export of your website files. We do not hold your digital presence hostage.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. How We Use Voice Data</h3>
          <p>When you speak with our AI Agent:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The conversation is recorded and transcribed to generate website copy.</li>
            <li>These recordings are stored securely within our private logs.</li>
            <li>We do not share these recordings with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
          <p>Under the NZ Privacy Act, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Ask for it to be corrected if you think it is wrong.</li>
            <li>Request that your data be deleted from our servers (subject to us needing to keep billing records for tax purposes).</li>
          </ul>
