                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Yes. You own your domain, content, and design from day one. We register domains in your name and manage hosting while you're a customer. If you cancel, you keep everything—we'll help you move it to any provider you choose.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">No lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. You keep your domain, content, and design—we'll help you move to any provider you choose. You'll lose the managed hosting, security updates, and "text us" support that's included in your subscription.</p>

                        <strong>Starter Plan:</strong> Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide">1. Payments</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup fees are paid 100% upfront</strong> to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.</p>

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide mt-8">2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)</h4>
                <p>We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee <strong>before the site goes live</strong>.</p>
                <p><em>Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).</em></p>

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide mt-8">3. Liability</h4>
                <p>We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).</p>
