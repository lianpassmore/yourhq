                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Yes. You own the domain name, the content, and the design. If you cancel, we transfer the domain and provide a ZIP file of your site code.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">No lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime. We will transfer your domain to your own account and give you your files. However, you will lose the hosting, security updates, and "text us" support.</p>

                        <strong>Launch & Growth Plans:</strong> No need! Unlimited text/photo updates are included in your monthly fee. Just text us.<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Starter Plan:</strong> Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide">1. Payments</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup fees are paid 100% upfront</strong> to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.</p>

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide mt-8">2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)</h4>
                <p>We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee <strong>before the site goes live</strong>.</p>
                <p><em>Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).</em></p>

                <h4 class="text-carbon font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-wide mt-8">3. Liability</h4>
                <p>We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).</p>
