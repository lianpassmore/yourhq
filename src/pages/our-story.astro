                <p class="font-medium text-xl">
                    Here's a stat that stuck in my head from my entrepreneurship studies: only 50% of small to medium businesses in New Zealand have a website.
                </p>
                <p class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-carbon mt-4">Half. In 2025.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                And I kept thinking about it. Especially as I watched friends build up these incredible profiles on Instagram and Facebook — years of work, thousands of followers, their whole customer base — and then poof. Banned. Hacked. Algorithm changed. Everything gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                All that work. All those contacts. Just... vanished.
            </p>

                    "I'm also the kind of person who checks websites before I hire anyone. If I'm picking between two tradies and one's got a beautiful website? I go with that tradie. Every time. It's not rational — but it's real."
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So when I started learning to code and building AI systems for my Master's, I kept coming back to this question: <strong>How do I create something that actually gets these business owners online?</strong> Not another DIY tool they'll never finish. A system that does the hard part for them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-carbon">And honestly? I think about my dad.</h3>
            <p>
                He ran a small business — <em>Maungi Tanks</em>. He's not with us anymore. But I imagine what it would've been like to build him a website. To see his face when he saw himself on the internet for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                He would have loved it. It would have made him proud.

                            When I started building AI agents for my Master's research, I accidentally taught myself to code. Then I had a thought: If I can build web apps... why not build websites?

                            When Lian asked if I'd pilot the service, I'd spent that morning wrestling with Wix, drowning in templates and decisions. Then she asked me a few questions, went away, and built me a website that actually looked like my business.

                            I nearly cried. Building a website was my barrier to market — the thing holding me back from launching my dream. And just like that, the blocker was gone. Now I'm here to help you do the same.
