            <p class="font-medium text-xl">
                Kia ora, I'm Lian and I've spent 15 years helping people communicate better. Building learning experiences. Designing systems. Translating complexity into clarity. But I never thought I'd be building websites.
            </p>
            <p>Here's how it actually happened.</p>

            <div class="my-12 space-y-12">
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-carbon">The Wix Era (aka "This Should Be Easy, Right?")</h3>
                    <p>Like most people, I started with Wix. Drag, drop, done. Except it wasn't done. It never looked quite right. The templates felt generic. And every time I wanted something specific, I'd hit a wall. But hey, at least I had a website.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-carbon">The WordPress Year (aka "I Can Learn Anything")</h3>
                    <p>Then I thought, "Right. WordPress. That's what the professionals use." So I taught myself WordPress. Spent a year getting comfortable with themes, plugins, and that particular brand of frustration that comes with trying to customize something that really doesn't want to be customized.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">It was better. But still... not quite there.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-carbon">The Canva Pivot (aka "Wait, Canva Does Websites Now?")</h3>
                    <p>When Canva launched websites, I was intrigued. As someone who already loved Canva for design, it seemed like the perfect middle ground. Quick. Visual. Easy to update.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">And for a while, it was great. But I kept bumping into the same limitation: I could make it look nice, but I couldn't make it do what I actually needed it to do.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-signal">The Plot Twist: Learning to Code</h3>
                <p>Here's where things got interesting.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">I was building AI agents for my Master's research—voice assistants, automated systems, tools to help businesses scale without losing their humanity. I needed these agents to talk to websites, to collect data, to integrate with systems.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">So I learned to code. Not to build websites. To build <em>infrastructure</em>.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">But then I had this thought: "If I can build web apps... why not try building an actual website?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-paper p-8 border-l-4 border-signal shadow-sm my-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Moment Everything Changed</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">I'm a storyteller. It's what I've always done—taking complex ideas and turning them into something people can see themselves in. Something that moves them to action.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">When I started coding my own sites, something clicked.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 font-medium">For the first time, I could take a message—a real human message—and translate it <em>exactly</em> into digital form. No templates. No compromises. Just pure translation: from heart to code to screen.</p>
                <p>And I absolutely loved it. The problem-solving. The logic puzzles. The satisfaction of making something work. As someone who thrives on learning and growth (it's literally my top value), coding felt like coming home.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-carbon">The Pilot Programme (aka "The Joy on Their Faces")</h3>
                <p>I started building websites for small business owners I knew. People like my dad, who ran a small business and was brilliant at the work but frustrated by the admin. People like my husband, who's in the trades. Real people doing real work.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">I'd sit down with them, listen to their story, understand their business. Then I'd go away and build them something that felt authentically <em>them</em>.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">When I delivered those websites, the reactions floored me.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
                    <li>"This is exactly us."</li>
                    <li>"How did you know?"</li>
                    <li>"This feels like me, but better."</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4 font-bold">That joy—that moment when someone sees themselves properly represented online for the first time—that's what hooked me.</p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-6">The Coffee Shop Revelation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">One day I was having coffee in Whangārei, scrolling through my phone, checking in on local businesses I loved. The baker who makes the best sourdough. The builder who renovated our house. The café where I'm writing this.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">And I realised: most of them were in a digital void.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Living on Facebook. Or Instagram. Or both. Entirely at the mercy of algorithms they couldn't control. One platform policy change away from losing their entire digital presence.</p>
                <p class="mb-8">These were businesses that had been around for 20 years. Businesses with loyal customers, excellent reputations, real value to offer. But online? They were tenants. Not owners.</p>
                
                <p class="font-bold text-xl text-center border-y-2 border-carbon py-6 my-8">
                    And I thought: <em>This isn't right.</em>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">The Mission: From Tenants to Owners</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">That's when YourHQ was born.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I want to make owning your own space online accessible for small to medium businesses in Aotearoa. Not renting space on someone else's platform. Not being subject to someone else's rules. <em>Owning</em> your digital home.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">My mission is simple: translate you—and your business—into YourHQ online.</p>
                <p>When someone sees your website, reads your content, and then meets you in person, I want them to feel like your website was a real, authentic representation of you. Not a template. Not a cookie-cutter design. <em>You.</em></p>

                    <p>Yes, I can code. Yes, I understand AI and automation and all the technical stuff.</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's what really matters: I'm studying Technological Futures. I'm fascinated by where technology is taking us and how we can make our digital experiences richer, more meaningful, more human.</p>
                    
                    <p>And I'm a storyteller through and through. Someone who prides herself on the ability to turn information into story—authentic, honest, engaging.</p>

                        <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">That combination? That's what makes YourHQ different.</p>
                        <p>I bring Silicon Valley infrastructure with Pacific hospitality. Code with conversation. Technical precision with genuine warmth.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4">Because at the end of the day, your website isn't just a digital brochure. It's the bridge between your business and your customers. Between who you are and who you're meant to serve.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2 font-medium">And that bridge deserves to be built properly.</p>
