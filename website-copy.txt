What They Say About The Process
"I was dreading building a website. Lian made it so easy — I literally just talked on the phone for 15 minutes and she handled everything else. I didn't have to write a single word."
— Dave, Electrician
"I've tried Wix three times and quit every time. YourHQ was the opposite of that stress. They just... did it. And it looks better than anything I could've made."

Based in Whangārei
Start Owning.
Castle on Rented Land.
Here's what nobody tells you:
If Instagram changes the algorithm tomorrow, does your business disappear?
If your Facebook account gets hacked, do you lose all your customers?
If Google shuts down your Business Profile, can anyone find you?
Right now, you're a Digital Tenant.
The landlord sets the rules. The landlord takes the profit. The landlord can evict you whenever they want.
It's time to become an Owner.
But Your Website?
In person, you're the real deal. You have presence. Reputation. Years of hard-earned trust.
But then someone Googles you... And they find nothing. Or worse — a broken website from 2012.
There's a disconnect.
Your website is your Digital Handshake. It's the first thing people experience before they meet you.
Who We Built This For
The Tradies
Electricians / Plumbers / Builders
The Pain
You're flat out on the tools. You hate admin. The last thing you want is to spend hours figuring out Wix.
The Fix
A site that ranks locally on Google and gets the phone ringing. No homework required.
The Creatives
Salons / Tattoo / Artists
The Pain
You've built a beautiful Instagram. But you need bookings and people to find your prices.
The Fix
A beautiful portfolio site that you actually own. Instagram can go down tomorrow — you're still standing.
The Professionals
Consultants / Legal / Coaches
The Pain
You need to pass the "Google Test" to win contracts. Clients are choosing competitors who look more established.
The Fix
A corporate-grade website that builds authority and makes you look like the expert you actually are.
No Jargon.

Terms & FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
Do I own my website?
Yes. You own the domain name, the content, and the design. If you cancel, we transfer the domain and provide a ZIP file of your site code.
What happens if I cancel?
No lock-in contracts. You can cancel anytime. We will transfer your domain to your own account and give you your files. However, you will lose the hosting, security updates, and "text us" support.
Can I update the site myself?
Launch & Growth Plans: No need! Unlimited text/photo updates are included in your monthly fee. Just text us.
Starter Plan: Updates are pay-as-you-go ($145/hr +GST). Since it's a simple one-page site, most people rarely need changes.
Terms of Trade (Plain English)
1. Payments
Setup fees are paid 100% upfront to secure your build slot. Because we turn websites around in 5 days, we allocate dedicated time for your project immediately upon booking. Monthly fees are billed automatically starting from your go-live date.
2. The "Love It" Guarantee (Refunds)
We take the risk, not you. Once we build your site, we send you a private preview link. If you don't love it, you can request a full refund of your setup fee before the site goes live.
Note: Refunds are minus hard costs (approx 3% Stripe processing fees + domain registration costs if we have already purchased your domain).
3. Liability
We strive for 99.9% uptime, but we are not liable for loss of business due to technical outages outside our control (e.g. if the entire Vercel network goes down).

title="The Accidental Web Developer | YourHQ" 
description="How a storyteller fell in love with code and built YourHQ."
Web Developer.
Here's how it actually happened.
The Wix Era (aka "This Should Be Easy, Right?")
Like most people, I started with Wix. Drag, drop, done. Except it wasn't done. It never looked quite right. The templates felt generic. And every time I wanted something specific, I'd hit a wall. But hey, at least I had a website.
The WordPress Year (aka "I Can Learn Anything")
Then I thought, "Right. WordPress. That's what the professionals use." So I taught myself WordPress. Spent a year getting comfortable with themes, plugins, and that particular brand of frustration that comes with trying to customize something that really doesn't want to be customized.
It was better. But still... not quite there.
The Canva Pivot (aka "Wait, Canva Does Websites Now?")
When Canva launched websites, I was intrigued. As someone who already loved Canva for design, it seemed like the perfect middle ground. Quick. Visual. Easy to update.
And for a while, it was great. But I kept bumping into the same limitation: I could make it look nice, but I couldn't make it do what I actually needed it to do.
The Plot Twist: Learning to Code
Here's where things got interesting.
I was building AI agents for my Master's research—voice assistants, automated systems, tools to help businesses scale without losing their humanity. I needed these agents to talk to websites, to collect data, to integrate with systems.
So I learned to code. Not to build websites. To build infrastructure.
But then I had this thought: "If I can build web apps... why not try building an actual website?"
The Moment Everything Changed
I'm a storyteller. It's what I've always done—taking complex ideas and turning them into something people can see themselves in. Something that moves them to action.
When I started coding my own sites, something clicked.
For the first time, I could take a message—a real human message—and translate it exactly into digital form. No templates. No compromises. Just pure translation: from heart to code to screen.
And I absolutely loved it. The problem-solving. The logic puzzles. The satisfaction of making something work. As someone who thrives on learning and growth (it's literally my top value), coding felt like coming home.
The Pilot Programme (aka "The Joy on Their Faces")
I started building websites for small business owners I knew. People like my dad, who ran a small business and was brilliant at the work but frustrated by the admin. People like my husband, who's in the trades. Real people doing real work.
I'd sit down with them, listen to their story, understand their business. Then I'd go away and build them something that felt authentically them.
When I delivered those websites, the reactions floored me.
"This is exactly us."
"How did you know?"
"This feels like me, but better."
That joy—that moment when someone sees themselves properly represented online for the first time—that's what hooked me.
The Coffee Shop Revelation
One day I was having coffee in Whangārei, scrolling through my phone, checking in on local businesses I loved. The baker who makes the best sourdough. The builder who renovated our house. The café where I'm writing this.
And I realised: most of them were in a digital void.
Living on Facebook. Or Instagram. Or both. Entirely at the mercy of algorithms they couldn't control. One platform policy change away from losing their entire digital presence.
These were businesses that had been around for 20 years. Businesses with loyal customers, excellent reputations, real value to offer. But online? They were tenants. Not owners.
And I thought: This isn't right.
The Mission: From Tenants to Owners
That's when YourHQ was born.
I want to make owning your own space online accessible for small to medium businesses in Aotearoa. Not renting space on someone else's platform. Not being subject to someone else's rules. Owning your digital home.
My mission is simple: translate you—and your business—into YourHQ online.
When someone sees your website, reads your content, and then meets you in person, I want them to feel like your website was a real, authentic representation of you. Not a template. Not a cookie-cutter design. You.
Why I'm Qualified to Do This (Beyond the Obvious)
Yes, I can code. Yes, I understand AI and automation and all the technical stuff.
But here's what really matters: I'm studying Technological Futures. I'm fascinated by where technology is taking us and how we can make our digital experiences richer, more meaningful, more human.
And I'm a storyteller through and through. Someone who prides herself on the ability to turn information into story—authentic, honest, engaging.
That combination? That's what makes YourHQ different.
I bring Silicon Valley infrastructure with Pacific hospitality. Code with conversation. Technical precision with genuine warmth.
Because at the end of the day, your website isn't just a digital brochure. It's the bridge between your business and your customers. Between who you are and who you're meant to serve.
And that bridge deserves to be built properly.
What This Means for You
If you're a small or medium business owner in New Zealand, tired of:
✕ Being algorithmically homeless
✕ Fighting with website builders that don't quite work
✕ Feeling like your online presence doesn't represent who you really are
✕ Spending hours on tech when you should be doing what you're actually good at
Then YourHQ might be for you.
I don't just build websites. I translate your business into digital form. I create infrastructure that works while you sleep. And I make sure that when someone lands on your site, they meet you—not some generic template version of you.

Why We Do Subscription, Not Project-Based
Your website is alive. It needs:
•
Security updates (weekly)
•
Performance tweaks (ongoing)
•
Hosting (always on)
•
The odd fix when something breaks
If you're paying per fix, you either:
A)
Get stuck with a broken site you can't afford to fix
B)
Overpay for simple changes
Subscription fixes this. It's predictable. It's fair.
Think of it like your phone plan vs. paying per text.
The "Love Your Launch" Guarantee
If you don't love it, we refund you.
What You're Actually Comparing
WHY $995 + $149/MO ISN'T CHEAP. IT'S FAIR.
Here's what the alternatives actually cost:
❌
DIY (Wix/Shopify/Squarespace)
•
$30–50/mo for tool
•
40+ hours of your time (@ $50/hr = $2,000)
•
Still looks generic
•
You're the support person
= $2,600–3,000 + your sanity
❌
Traditional Agency
•
$5,000–15,000 setup
•
$100–250/hr for changes
•
6–12 week build time
•
You're often abandoned after launch
= $10,000–20,000+ over 2 years
✓
YourHQ
•
$995 setup (5 days)
•
$149/mo (forever support + annual refresh)
•
First 2 years = $4,573
•
You own it. We handle it.
Professional build + 2 years support = $4,573
That's less than half what most agencies charge just to build it.
title="Privacy Policy | YourHQ"
description="Privacy Policy for YourHQ - Our commitment to data sovereignty and security."
YourHQ operates under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020. Beyond legal compliance, our core philosophy is Data Sovereignty: We are the caretakers of your digital assets, but you remain the owner.
1. Information We Collect
To build and maintain your website, we collect:
Business Identity: Name, contact details, and business descriptions.
Website Content: Images, text, logos, and files you upload to our Shared Drive.
Voice Data: Audio recordings from your "Drive-Home Interview" with our AI agent.
Technical Data: Analytics on how your website performs (if on the Growth plan).
2. Our Technology Stack & Data Storage
We believe in radical transparency regarding where your data lives. We use best-in-class infrastructure to ensure speed and security.
Supabase:
We use Supabase for our database. We implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies, meaning your data is cryptographically segregated. Only authorized users (you and our admins) can access your specific records.
Stripe:
We use Stripe for all payments. YourHQ never sees or stores your credit card numbers. Stripe adheres to the highest level of PCI Service Provider Level 1 standards.
ElevenLabs:
Used for our AI Interview Agent. Your voice data is processed solely to transcribe information for your website build. We do not use your voice to clone your identity.
Vercel:
Your website files are hosted on Vercel's global edge network to ensure 99.9% uptime and lightning-fast loading speeds for your customers.
3. Data Sovereignty (Ownership)
This is where we differ from platforms like Facebook or Instagram:
You own your content. We claim no intellectual property rights over the text and images you provide.
You own your customer list. Any leads generated by your website belong 100% to you. We do not mine, sell, or share your customer data.
Portability. If you choose to leave YourHQ (after the minimum term), we provide you with a static export of your website files. We do not hold your digital presence hostage.
4. How We Use Voice Data
When you speak with our AI Agent (Penny/Lian's Digital Twin):
The conversation is recorded and transcribed to generate website copy.
These recordings are stored securely within our private logs.
We do not share these recordings with third parties for marketing purposes.
5. Your Rights
Under the NZ Privacy Act, you have the right to:
Ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you.
Ask for it to be corrected if you think it is wrong.
Request that your data be deleted from our servers (subject to us needing to keep billing records for tax purposes).
